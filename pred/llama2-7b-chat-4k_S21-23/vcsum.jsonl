{"pred": " Based on the recording of the conference, the main points are as follows:\n\n1. The speaker believes that the current education system in China is facing a major challenge in balancing the development of the individual and the collective. The education system has been focused on cultivating individuals who are capable of competing with others, rather than fostering a culture of cooperation and collaboration.\n2. The speaker suggests that the root cause of this problem is the emphasis on the concept of \"entering the arena\" (进人头地) in Chinese culture. This concept is highly valued in Chinese society, but it has led to a focus on individual competition rather than collective cooperation.\n3. The speaker believes that the solution to this problem is to shift the focus of education from individual competition to the development of a unique and special set of skills for each individual. This approach would allow each person to develop their own strengths and abilities, rather than striving to be the same as everyone else.\n4.

The speaker highlights the idea that modernity is not just a matter of time, but also a matter of space. The modern era is not just about the passage of time, but also about the transformation of space.\n3. The speaker discusses the concept of \"special term\" in the context of contemporary art. This term refers to the idea that art is not just about creating something new, but also about challenging and questioning the existing art system.\n4. The speaker mentions the importance of considering the historical context of modern art. Modern art is not just about the present moment, but also about the past and the way it shapes our understanding of the present.\n5. The speaker discusses the idea of \"abstraction\" in modern art. Abstraction refers to the process of removing the subject from the artwork and focusing on the form and structure. The speaker suggests that abstraction is a key aspect of modern art, but it cannot be fully understood without considering the historical context.\n6.
