{"pred": " In a surprising turn of events, the late Mikhail Kalashnikov, the designer of the iconic AK-47 assault rifle, expressed regret and guilt over the deaths caused by his weapon in a letter to the Russian Orthodox Church shortly before his death. The letter, published by Izvestia, reveals that Kalashnikov struggled with the moral implications of creating a weapon that has killed millions worldwide. He questioned whether he was responsible for the deaths and expressed a desire to defend his country, rather than have his weapon used by criminals and terrorists.\n\nKalashnikov's letter is a fascinating insight into the mind of a man who spent his life designing and perfecting assault rifles. Despite his fame and awards, he felt a deep sense of spiritual pain and guilt towards the end of his life. The letter highlights the complex and often uncomfortable relationship between weapon designers and the weapons they create, as well as the role of the Russian Orthodox Church in supporting both the creators and the soldiers who use these weapons.\n\nThe news comes as a surprise to many, as Kalashnikov had previously refused to accept responsibility for the deaths caused by his weapon. His funeral in December was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who hailed him as a hero. However, the letter suggests that Kalashnikov's feelings of guilt and regret were a more complex and nuanced emotion than his public persona.\n\nThe AK-47 is one of the most widely recognized and widely used weapons in the world, with over 100 million sold worldwide. Its simplicity and durability made it a favorite among soldiers and insurgent groups, but its use by terrorists and criminals has also made it a symbol of violence and conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, Mikhail Kalashnikov's letter to the Russian Orthodox Church is a remarkable revelation of his inner thoughts and feelings towards the end of his life.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability.

Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

McCullough's conviction was based on a tip that led to a new trial, where a judge found that the prosecution had insufficient evidence to support the conviction. The case was originally solved through a tip from a half-sister of McCullough's, who revealed that her dying mother had whispered to her that McCullough was the killer. At the time of the murder, McCullough was in Rockford, Illinois, trying to enlist in the U.S. Air Force, and he passed a polygraph test about his alibi. Newly discovered phone records and other evidence supported McCullough's aliba, leading the state's attorney to request that he be released from prison. The case has been re-examined by a six-month review of evidence conducted by DeKalb County State's Attorney Richard Schmack, who found that the prosecution had insufficient evidence to support the conviction. The exact time of Maria's abduction has been in dispute almost from the beginning, and the investigation turned up no solid leads to her whereabouts.

McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial. A friend of the kidnapped girl picked McCullough out of a photo lineup when the case was reopened.

The study exposed MRSA to cigarette smoke extract and observed that it became harder to kill, with a fourfold increase in resistance to macrophage killing. Additionally, the smoke-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls.

The $325,000 settlement, approved by a New Jersey court, will give each of the 52 cheerleaders $2,500 for each season they worked, covering the 2012-13 and 2013-14 NFL seasons. The settlement comes after a class-action lawsuit was filed in 2014 by a former cheerleader, Krystal C, who claimed the women made only $150 per game and nothing for practice time. The Jets had initially denied the claims, but both parties have now agreed to the settlement to avoid further litigation.\n\nThis settlement is not an isolated incident, as other NFL teams have also faced similar wage lawsuits. The Buffalo Bills cheerleaders were recently granted class-action status in a similar wage suit against their team, and the Cincinnati Bengals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Oakland Raiders, and Buffalo Bills have also been sued. In these cases, the cheerleaders have argued that they were not paid fairly for their work and were instead treated as independent contractors rather than employees.\n\nThe issue of fair pay for NFL cheerleaders is not a new one, and it has sparked a larger conversation about the treatment of women in the NFL. State Senator Diane Savino has called for the NFL to step forward as a leader and develop uniform rules for their teams to ensure that all cheerleaders in every state receive the employee pay and protections they deserve.

The majority of the affected individuals are children, and the illness is characterized by a sudden onset of weakness in the arms or legs.

In related news, a survey of 77 patients with AFM found that 64% had some improvement in symptoms after hospitalization, but 36% showed no improvement, and none were fully recovered. Additionally, no enteroviruses or other pathogens have been confirmed to be the cause of AFM, but some patients have tested positive for EV-D68, an enterovirus that has been linked to respiratory illness.

The dinosaur, named Caihong juji, meaning \"rainbow with a big crest,\" had stunningly preserved feathers with colors that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The discovery suggests that feathers evolved for display purposes before being used for flight, and that birds evolved from small feathered dinosaurs near the end of the Jurassic period. Caihong had a bird-like body with the necessary feathers for flight, but it also had a Velociraptor-like skull with sharp teeth and a crested head. The dinosaur's holotype specimen is a nearly complete skeleton with associated plumage preserved on a slab and counter slab from Gangou, Qinglong, northern Hebei Province, Tiaojishan Formation, early Late Jurassic, ~161 Myr9. Caihong is the earliest-known creature with asymmetrical feathers, and its plumage may have helped the animal to get in the air. The discovery of Caihong provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and the origins of birds, and sheds light on the life and behavior of a small, rainbow-colored dinosaur that lived 160 million years ago.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

However, the Senate has rejected this proposal, and Democrats have expressed their intention to reject any changes to the health law. The White House has also stated that it will not negotiate on a short-term government funding bill.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been a key figure in pushing a hardline Democratic legislative strategy, urging the president not to attend a meeting with the four congressional leaders ahead of the deadline. Reid believes that attending such a meeting would give the false impression that a serious negotiation was occurring.\n\nThe potential shutdown could have significant impacts on the economy, particularly in the Washington area, where federal agencies are located. Local governments are preparing for the possibility of lost income tax revenue from tens of thousands of idled federal workers. The US Postal Service and Amtrak have announced that they will continue to operate during a potential shutdown, while the District of Columbia is attempting to avoid a shutdown by declaring every city employee essential.\n\nAir traffic controllers are considered essential, so planes will fly, but without \"nonessential\" support staff, those planes could be delayed. Federal benefits may continue to be processed, but with fewer workers to process them, no new applications would be accepted and \"serious backlogs\" would be expected.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The mission, now called the Parker Solar Probe, will attempt to get close to the sun's surface and explore the mysteries of the solar wind, corona, and the extreme heat of the sun's atmosphere. The probe will be equipped with advanced instruments to study the solar wind and its interactions with the sun's magnetic fields, and will trace the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind. The mission will also pass through the origin of the solar particles with the highest energy and will aim to answer questions about how stars work and improve space weather forecasting. The probe will be launched in summer 2018 and will make a Venus flyby before reaching its first perihelion, or the closest point to the sun, in 2020.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

We also examine the ongoing debate over Pluto's status as a planet and the reasons why astronomers believe it should not be considered a planet.\n\nAccording to Mike Brown, an astronomer at Caltech, the discovery of Planet Nine is based on mathematical and computer modeling, and its detection is expected within five years. Brown and his co-author, Konstantin Batygin, believe that Planet Nine is the best evidence for a true ninth planet to take Pluto's place in the history books.\n\nThe article also highlights the ongoing debate over Pluto's status as a planet. While some argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet due to its size and other characteristics, others argue that it does not meet the criteria for a planet. According to Brown, the International Astronomical Union's decision to demote Pluto in 2006 was not an option, as it would have led to the admission of hundreds or even thousands of other wannabe planets in the outer Solar System.\n\nThe article also includes an interview with Brown, in which he explains why he believes Pluto should not be considered a planet and why he has no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion. He also discusses the importance of understanding the solar system and the value of embracing the reality that Pluto is not a planet.\n\nIn conclusion, the discovery of Planet Nine and the ongoing debate over Pluto's status as a planet highlight the complex and fascinating nature of planetary science.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes.

The study highlights the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

According to a new study, harvesting energy from distant stars isn't just the best way to increase a civilization's available resources but also the only way to prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving that civilization totally alone in the vastness of space. The study suggests that if humans hope to meet aliens in distant galaxies, they will need to capture stars from other galaxies and reel them in before they become permanently inaccessible.\n\nPassage 2:\nThe Internet Archive's Wayback Machine is a collection of outsider-uploaded WARCs, which are being kept for reference and clarity for the Wayback Team while also being accessible to the general public.\n\nPassage 3:\nAdvanced extraterrestrial civilizations need enormous amounts of energy, and science fiction author Olaf Stapledon described spherical, energy-trapping alien structures in his 1937 novel. Physicist Freeman Dyson proposed similar structures in a scientific paper in 1960, and astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev proposed that advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems to capture energy. Dyson spheres would be made from millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, and solar sails could remain in place by balancing against the pressure of light from the sun.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

Passage 2 highlights the implications of these discoveries, suggesting that the shifts in the East African climate may have driven toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives.\n\nAccording to the study, the earliest innovations were held in the palm of the hand and shaped like a tear drop with a rounded end and a pointed eye. The edges were wavy and sharp, and they look as if they were great at chopping down branches or cutting up the carcasss. The archaeological records from the Middle Stone Age at Olorgesailie reveal \"the roots of that kind of migration,\" and it is no different than what humans all over the world do today, when times are tough, we look for greener pastures.\n\nThe study also suggests that the gaps in the evidence across Africa, the Middle Stone Age is characterized by the absence or rarity of large cutting tools and the presence of prepared core technologies for making sophisticated points and blades. The transition between the African Early and Middle Stone Age occurred around the time that our own species, Homo sapiens, was evolving across the continent.\n\nIn conclusion, the study provides new insights into the early human innovation and trading networks in the East African region, shedding light on the roots of modern human behaviors and the complexity of the human revolution.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The passage explains that the last Congress passed the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006, which revoked the right to habeas corpus for detainees at Guantánamo Bay and foreigners labeled as \"enemy combatants.\" This provision applies to legal residents of the US as well, potentially throwing them into prison with no legal recourse. The Supreme Court has heard cases challenging the detention of Guantánamo detainees, and the MCA has eroded the foundation of the US legal and constitutional framework.\n\nPassage 2:\nIn a groundbreaking case, a New York judge granted two Stony Brook University research chimpanzees, Hercules and Leo, the right to have their day in court through a writ of habeas corpus. This is the first time an animal has been covered by a writ of habeas corpus, and the ruling could force the university to release the primates.

Until now in the US, those who've used this legal tactic have been human.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes.

The US Justice Department is preparing to charge Gibson Guitar Corporation with trafficking in illegally obtained wood, specifically Madagascar ebony, in violation of the Lacey Act. The Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency has found that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood, and the company has vigorously denied these allegations, maintaining that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law. The recent raid seized legally obtained wood from India, according to a company attorney.\n\nOther guitar manufacturers are also affected by the Lacey Act, which has led some to express concern over the law's burdensome requirements. Attorney Ronald Bienstock represents guitar builders who are worried about proving the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago, as the law is retroactive. George Gruhn, one of the world's top dealers of old guitars, acknowledges that the government has tried to create exemptions to cover vintage instruments, but he is hesitant to play it safe and has nearly eliminated his business that deals with overseas buyers.\n\nIn a separate news story, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, which are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

The study used infrared telescopes to study the Martian atmosphere over six years and found that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium, indicating that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past. The study estimates that the ocean was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m.\n\nNews Passage 3:\nA new analysis of the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere has revealed that the planet's thin atmosphere can be seen in a photo taken by the Viking 1 orbiter. The study used some of the world's most powerful telescopes to determine that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface four billion years ago. The study found that Earth and Mars started out with identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water, but on Mars, the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking into outer space. The study estimates that the early Martian atmosphere was unusually rich in heavy hydrogen and that much of it escaped along with the ordinary variety, suggesting that the true amount of water was much larger than previously thought.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

{"pred": " A new study published in the journal Evolution suggests that dinosaurs may have sounded differently than previously thought. Researchers analyzed the vocal behavior of birds and found that they use a specialized way of emitting sound called closed-mouth vocalization, which is likely how some dinosaurs vocalized too. The study suggests that large-bodied dinosaurs may have had a similar vocal ability to birds, which could mean that they made low, throaty whooshes rather than the high-pitched screams often depicted in movies. The study also found that closed-mouth vocalizations have evolved at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds and dinosaurs. The researchers believe that this behavior can emerge in different archosaur groups under different circumstances, which could mean that some dinosaurs may have used this vocalization method during mating displays. The study offers clues about what the sounds of non-avian dinosaurs may have sounded like, suggesting a very different Jurassic world where dinosaurs were feathered and made booming, closed-mouth sounds. Future research will aim to understand the sounds produced by extinct early avian species and their dinosaur ancestors by integrating information from fossils, experimental physiology, gene expression, and sound modeling.", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.
