{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the question \"Which models/frameworks do they compare to?\" and answer it based on the article. \n\nLooking through the article, especially the part about experiments, I see that the s2sL approach is compared to several other models. \n\nIn the section where they talk about the Anger/Happy classification, they mention that they not only compare to MLP but also consider \"Eusboost\" and \"MWMOTE\" as other methods. \n\nSo the models/framework being compared to are MLP, Eusboost, and MWMOTE. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be the names of", "answers": ["MLP", "Eusboost, MWMOTE"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2474}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the NER model in the article learns from both text and images. The question is asking whether the model uses text and images as inputs.\n\nLooking through the article, I see that the model is described as being able to incorporate visual contexts. The introduction mentions that the model uses image and text for recognition. The section on the proposed methods also states that the model takes as input \"both image and text\" for NER. Additionally, the dataset is mentioned as including image and caption pairs. The results section shows that the model can be trained with visual contexts, and the modality attention module is", "answers": ["Yes", "Yes"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3784}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to determine if the article evaluates only on English datasets. The question is asking whether the datasets used in the experiments are exclusive to English. \n\nLooking through the article, I see that the datasets mentioned are the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank. The WSJ is a part of the North American English corpus, so that's one instance. \n\nThe article also mentions the \"WSJ corpus\" and the \"billion word language modeling benchmark dataset\" which is a common dataset for English. Additionally, the experiments are about POS tagging and dependency parsing, which are part of the standard", "answers": ["Yes", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4320}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the highest MRR score mentioned in the article. Let me go through the article to locate where MRR is discussed.\n\nFirst, in the introduction, the article states that the system achieved \"highest 'MRR' score for Factoid Question Answering task\" in the third test batch. Then, in the related work section, it mentions that the highest 'MRR' achieved in the 6th edition of BioASQ is '0.4325'. \n\nThen, in the experiments section, the article says that the system achieved a 'MRR' score '0.6", "answers": ["0.5115", "0.6103"], "all_classes": null, "length": 6810}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the dataset(s) that the article evaluate on. The question is asking for the datasets used in the experiments.\n\nLooking through the article, I see a section titled \"Experiments\" where they mention datasets. The first paragraph in the experiments section says, \"For both POS tagging and dependency parsing, we run experiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank.\" \n\nAdditionally, there's a part about the training data: \"we use sections 02-21 of WSJ corpus as training data and evaluate on section 23.\" \n\nAlso, there's", "answers": [" Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4327}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's look at the question. It's asking about how the authors evidence the claim that engineers find it difficult to choose from multiple frameworks, models, and optimization techniques. \n\nI need to go through the article to find where this is mentioned. The article is about NeuronBlocks, a DNN toolkit. The introduction mentions that engineers face challenges when applying DNN models, and the motivation for the toolkit is to address these. \n\nLooking at the \"Related Work\" section, the article states that \"building models under these frameworks requires a large overhead of mastering these framework details.\" This is the part where the problem is", "answers": ["By conducting a survey among engineers", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1692}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find the part of the article where they mention which benchmarks they achieved the \"state of the art\". \n\nLooking through the sections, there's a part about \"KBQA Enhanced by Relation Detection\" and then a section \"Experiments\" where they talk about datasets. \n\nIn the \"Experiments\" section, there's a part where they say \"our proposed HR-BiLSTM outperated the best baselines on both tasks by margins of 2-3%\". The tasks mentioned here are \"SimpleQuestions\" and \"WebQSP\". \n\nAlso, in the \"Results\" part,", "answers": ["SimpleQuestions, WebQSP", "WebQSP, SimpleQuestions"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4524}
