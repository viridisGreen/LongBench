According to a study published in the journal Infection and Immunity, exposure to cigarette smoke enhances the resistance of MRSA to toxic substances, making it more difficult to kill. The study found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract were four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. Additionally, the study found that cigarette smoke extract-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. The increased resistance continued for 24 hours after exposure, suggesting it could be inherited.\n\nAnother study, led by Dr. Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego, found that cigarette smoke functions much like an alarm to MRSA, warning it to activate its defenses. In lab studies in human cells and whole mice, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract became harder to kill.

The results showed that the most important person in the world is actually Carl Linnaeus, a 18th-century Swedish naturalist, rather than the more commonly expected figures such as Michael Jackson or Frank Sinatra.\n\nThe study also found that each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, which means that the most important historical figures are born in Western countries after the 17th century and are male.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth and found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose, suggesting that a standing model was used to imprint the patterns. The researchers concluded that the linen appears patched with bloodstains from a standing model, not a crucified man or facedown corpse. This finding adds to evidence that the shroud is a medieval fraud. The investigation also found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part, with some bloodstains tracing angles at odds with each other. The study's findings are consistent with the idea that the shroud is not a genuine religious relic, but rather a medieval artistic or didactic representation. The Vatican regards the shroud as an icon, rather than a religious relic, and the church has never weighed in on its authenticity nor officially rejected it. The controversy surrounding the shroud's authenticity has been ongoing for centuries, with some claiming that it is the burial cloth of Jesus, while others argue that it is a medieval forgery.

According to Rowling, there are currently 8 million children separated from their families and locked away in institutions, often in poor conditions, due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. The campaign aims to shed light on the lives of these children and advocate for their rights to be with their families.\n\nRowling has also founded the organization Lumos, which works to close child institutions and provide alternative care for children who cannot be with their families.

It also notes that the solution to this problem is not just providing better facilities in institutions, but rather keeping children with their families and communities.\n\nRowling has committed to becoming the president of Lumos for life and hopes that within her lifetime, the concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem like a cruel and fictional world.

This dinosaur lived around 161 million years ago during the Jurassic period and had iridescent feathers on its head, neck, and chest, similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The feathers were found to have pancake-shaped melanosomes, which are responsible for pigmentation, and the colors were observed to shift and change depending on the angle of light. The discovery of Caihong suggests that the evolution of feathers in dinosaurs may have been more colorful than previously thought, and that the display of these feathers may have played a role in mating and social interactions. Additionally, the discovery of Caihong provides evidence that the evolution of flight in birds may have originated from the display of feathers rather than the actual act of flying.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The tax has also been criticized for being inconsistent, as it exempts fast food restaurants and convenience stores, while targeting vending machine companies. The repeal of Cook County's soda tax in Illinois has also been seen as a victory for the beverage industry, with giant corporations like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo spending millions fighting the unpopular tax.

The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line.

According to BuzzFeed, Martinez's mom said her daughter had gone to the area to work on a marijuana farm and she hadn't heard from her in a week. The Sheriff's Office was unable to find Martinez or contact anyone who might know her, so Martinez was added to the California Department of Justice's list of missing people.

A woman in Central California, Myrna Arias, was fired from her job at Intermex Wire Transfer LLC after she refused to install an app that tracked her location even when she was off the clock. The app, provided by Xora, Inc., had a GPS function that tracked the exact location of the user. Arias objected to the monitoring of her location during non-work hours and complained to her boss, John Stubits, that this was an invasion of her privacy.\n2. Intermex required its employees to use the app to monitor their locations during work hours, but Arias was not given the option to turn off the app when she was not working. Stubits admitted that the company was monitoring its employees' locations during off-duty hours, and he bragged that he knew how fast Arias was driving at specific moments.\n3. Arias sued Intermex in Kern County Superior Court, claiming that the company's actions were illegal and violated her privacy rights. She seeks an injunction and general, special, and punitive damages for invasion of privacy, retaliation, labor code violations, intentional interference with contract, wrongful termination, and unfair business practices.\n4. The case raises questions about the legality of employers monitoring their employees' locations during off-duty hours and the potential violation of privacy rights. Employers may have legitimate business interests in monitoring employees during work hours, but there are limits to how far they can go in monitoring employees outside of work.\n5. The use of apps and other tracking technologies to monitor employees has become more common in recent years, particularly in the service industry. However, there are concerns about the impact on employee privacy and the potential for abuse by employers.\n6. The case also highlights the importance of employee training and education about company policies and procedures. Employers should ensure that their employees understand the reasons for monitoring their locations during work hours and the consequences of violating company policies.\n7.

Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called. Arias' attorney tells Courthouse News that there was no way to turn the app off, as it would constantly run in the background. \"She found it very offensive that they were treating her like a felon,\" the attorney says.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time.

Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

This trend suggests that the current guidelines for screening may need to be reevaluated. Younger patients are more likely to have advanced cancer and are more likely to undergo aggressive treatment, but they also live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence. The reasons for this increase in colon cancer among younger adults are unknown, but risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and a poor diet may play a role. These findings raise questions about whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age, but more research is needed to determine whether this would be beneficial.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained.

The find is significant as it undermines the pillar of support for climate change, not humans, causing the extinctions, as humans lived alongside these animals and hunted them.

It is a visceral and harrowing experience that begins with the history of black people in the United States, including the Great Migration and white flight, leading to the overcrowding of black residents in urban pockets. The film then focuses on the events leading up to the riots, including a police raid on an unlicensed nightclub and the arrest of black partygoers. The stomach-churning horror begins immediately and does not let up for 2 hours and 23 minutes, with no reprieve. The film addresses the systemic oppression and mistreatment of black people in the United States and the police brutality that led to the Algiers Motel siege. It also shows the aftermath of the siege, including the trial of the three officers involved and the impact on the community. The film is controversial and has been criticized for its portrayal of police brutality and its lack of judgment. However, it is also praised for its immersion and its ability to get under the viewer's skin. The film is a powerful and important work that is sure to spark conversations and debates about race and police brutality in the United States.", "answers": ["Kathryn Bigelow's Detroit tells the story of a black singer who takes refuge in a dingy motel to escape the 1967 Motor City riots.

Here's what critics are saying: \"Bigelow drills down into one of American history's most egregious cases of abuse of police power, bringing it to life with visceral detail and slowed-down meticulousness\" in what \"feels like her timeliest movie yet,\" writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. It's \"daring, sophisticated and unforgettably disturbing.\" And \"in scale, scope and the space it offers for a long-awaited moral reckoning, it's nothing less than monumental.\" \"It's hard to overstate just how visceral and harrowing an experience it is,\" writes Lindsey Bahr at the AP, calling Detroit \"a well-made and evocative film\" jam-packed with \"stomach-churning horror.\" She argues there could be more nuance and perspective. But \"maybe anger is all you're supposed to feel when you step outside the theater.

Peter Howell's main gripe is that the film \"tries to tell us everything about the circumstances without telling us much about the people.\" But Detroit still makes for \"urgent viewing,\" he writes at the Toronto Star. Why? \"The injustice and anger behind it all feels like current reality, even a half-century on,\" when \"a person's skin can still determine everything from employment opportunities to treatment by police.\""], "all_classes": null, "length": 3798}

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

{"pred": " In a recent breakthrough, scientists have uncovered new evidence of early human innovation in Kenya's Southern Rift Valley. Excavations at five sites dating back 320,000 years have revealed distinct differences in stone tools compared to older deposits in the area, suggesting technological advancements. The findings challenge the previous belief that modern human behaviors emerged outside of Africa and instead suggest that early Homo sapiens evolved in Africa. The discovery of obsidian tools and red pigment chunks at least 25-50 kilometers away from the excavation sites indicates long-distance trading networks among early human populations. The new reports fit with genetic evidence that Homo sapiens originated in Africa between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. The findings provide strong indicators that early Homo sapiens were at least as smart as the scientists investigating them and suggest that the roots of the \"human revolution\" can be traced back to Africa.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science.

Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

Katriuk was a subject of controversy due to his alleged involvement in a massacre in Belarus during World War II.\n2. Russia has requested that Canada extradite Katriuk to face trial for war crimes, but the Canadian government has refused to do so.\n3. The Simon Wiesenthal Centre, a Jewish human rights organization, has called on the Canadian government to take action against Katriuk and hold him accountable for his alleged crimes.\n4. In 1999, the Federal Court of Canada ruled that Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretenses by not disclosing his collaboration with the Nazis, but found insufficient evidence to prosecute him.\n5. In 2007, the Harper cabinet decided not to revoke Katriuk's citizenship, despite ongoing calls for his deportation.\n6. The Ukrainian Canadian Congress has urged the Canadian government to ignore Russia's demands regarding Katriuk, citing a previous finding by the Federal Court that found no evidence of his participation in war crimes.\n7.

The new law makes possession of up to 2 ounces of marijuana a petty offense that can result in a fine, rather than criminal charges. The law also permits the use of marijuana for religious, medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. The legislation paves the way for the development of a lawful industry for medical ganja and industrial hemp. The move comes after decades of debate and follows changes to drug laws in U.S. states. Jamaica's national security minister, Peter Bunting, said the legislation does not mean Jamaica plans to soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking or cultivation of illegal plots. The law also allows for the licensing of a cannabis licensing authority to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and scientific purposes. The Rastafarian spiritual movement can now freely use marijuana for sacramental purposes for the first time on the island. The move by Jamaican lawmakers adds to an international trend of easing restrictions on marijuana for medical or personal use. More than 20 U.S. states allow some form of medical marijuana, and last year Colorado and Washington legalized personal use. On Tuesday, Alaska became the third U.S. state to legalize the recreational use of marijuana for adults.

The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep.

Easily distilling the massive report, the Washington Post lays out its five \"most serious accusations,\" including that the CIA \"missed warning signs\" and \"misread how dangerous Libya ... was at the time.\" New evidence of “culpability or wrongdoing” on Clinton's part is lacking in the report, despite it being “one of the longest, costliest, and most bitterly partisan congressional investigations in history,\" according to the New York Times. Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed. According to the Hill, a Democratic lawmaker on the House Benghazi committee calls it \"one of the saddest exercises I've ever engaged in\" during 20 years in Congress. He accuses Republicans of hiding the final report from Democrats to avoid having it fact-checked. Zeroing in on what it calls the \"most revealing paragraph\" in the report, Vox concludes there's a pattern of spinning \"non-damning facts as damning\" for the Obama administration. The paragraph in question admits there were no US forces close enough to prevent the attack but insists that, in itself, was a failure on the part of the White House. \"I think it's time to move on,\" the AP quotes Clinton as saying after the release of the report, which she says includes nothing not previously discovered by an accountability board."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3608}

The detective, Buck Garner, also said the bloodhound found Graham's scent at an industrial site about a mile from downtown Charlottesville. The new details emerged in a daylong pretrial hearing for Jesse Matthew Jr., who is charged with capital murder in Graham's 2014 disappearance and death. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. Garner testified about his involvement in the early days of the investigation, working with a 7-year-old bloodhound named Shaker, who traced Graham's scent to Charlottesville's downtown, where she was last seen.

The bloodhound's work provided the basis for police to obtain a search warrant for Matthew's apartment and vehicle. The defense unsuccessfully challenged the search warrant in court, arguing that the search dog's findings were inconsistent with witness accounts and video surveillance evidence, that detectives might have misled a magistrate to obtain the warrant and that there was not probable cause for police to conduct those searches.
