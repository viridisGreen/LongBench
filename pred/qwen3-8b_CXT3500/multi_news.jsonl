The conviction was overturned after a new trial was granted by Judge William Brady. The main reasons given were that there was \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly convicted. The evidence included phone records showing he was in Rockford at the time of the abduction, which contradicted the original timeline. The case had been unsolved for 58 years, and a tip from McCullough's half-sister led to the re-examination. The prosecutor, Richard Schmack, reviewed 4,500 pages of documents and found the evidence supporting McCullough's alibi. The family of the victim, including Charles Ridulph, was upset, as they believed McCullough was guilty.

McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping.

The study found that MRSA exposed to smoke was four times more resistant to macrophage killing. The resistance lasted 24 hours, which could be inherited. In mice, smoke-exposed MRSA caused higher mortality. The study also compared e-cigarette vapor, which had a smaller effect.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about a study by Young-Ho Eom from the University of Toulouse analyzing Wikipedia articles to determine the most important people. They used methods similar to Google's PageRank algorithm. The initial result was Frank Sinatra as the most important, then Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. But when considering all 24 language editions, Adolf Hitler came first, with Michael Jackson second and Madonna third. The study aimed to check if Wikipedia's attention is skewed by gender, time, or location. They found that most important figures are from Western countries after the 17th century and are male. The study also mentions that Linnaeus was the top in the initial analysis due to his classification system leading to many links. They used a combination of PageRank and CheiRank (2DRank) to get the final rankings.\n\nPassage 2 is about the Internet Archive's efforts to archive web pages to prevent broken links. They crawl sites to save pages and their references, so when original pages change or disappear, the archived versions are preserved. The goal is to fix broken links by replacing them with archived versions.\n\nPassage 3 is another study by Eom's team, this time focusing on the most influential thinker. They used Wikipedia's link structure to determine who's at the center of the most extensive network. The result was Carl Linnaeus, the father of taxonomy, beating out everyone else, including Jesus and Hitler. The reason given is that scientific names in every Wikipedia edition link back to Linnaeus. This contrasts with a previous study that found Karl Marx as the most influential academic.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. The key points are the two studies by Eom's team, the use of PageRank and CheiRank, the different results based on different criteria (most important vs. most influential), the mention of Linnaeus, the skew in Wikipedia's content towards Western males, and the Internet Archive's work on preserving links. I should also note the discrepancy between the two studies (one about importance, one about influence) and the different outcomes.

Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague. When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

Isaiah Silva is asking for $25k a month in spousal support, arguing that Frances left him broke after they married. He left a steady job and claims Frances promised to cover his expenses, including his child's private school and housing.

Damon said there's a difference between minor actions like patting someone's butt and serious crimes like rape, suggesting that the former should be treated less severely. Milano responded by calling this \"Orwellian\" and comparing sexual misconduct to cancer, emphasizing that all forms are serious. Minnie Driver also criticized Damon, saying men can't understand the daily impact of abuse and that their attempts to categorize misconduct are tone-deaf and part of the problem.\n\nPassage 2 expands on Driver's comments, explaining that she and Milano were responding to Damon's ABC interview where he defended Louis CK, a comedian accused of misconduct. Driver argues that men shouldn't dictate what constitutes abuse, as they can't fully grasp the personal and systemic issues. She also mentions the broader context of the #MeToo movement and the ongoing reckoning in Hollywood following Harvey Weinstein's allegations. Damon's comments on Louis CK are questioned, as Driver suggests he might be downplaying the severity of his actions by not apologizing.\n\nPassage 4 is a quote from someone who has experienced all levels of the sexual assault spectrum, stating that each form of abuse is connected to a patriarchal system that normalizes misogyny. This seems to be a response to Damon's spectrum comment, reinforcing the idea that all forms of misconduct are part of a larger systemic issue.\n\nNow, I need to synthesize these points into a concise summary.

The toxicology report found VX on Kim's face and eyes, and one of the women got sick. The VX is highly potent, can be absorbed through skin, and is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention. Experts suggest a small amount was used, possibly on cloths. North Korea hasn't confirmed Kim's identity, and there's a diplomatic crisis. The airport is being decontaminated, but VX is persistent. Kim was a critic of North Korea, exiled, and had a history of being caught with fake passports.\n\nPassage 3 confirms the use of VX in the assassination, with police stating it was detected on Kim's face and eyes. The two women were accused of applying the toxin, and one got sick. The airport wasn't decontaminated for 11 days, raising safety concerns. North Korea accuses Malaysia of fabricating evidence, and there's a diplomatic crisis. Toxicologists are puzzled how the women weren't affected, possibly due to an antidote. North Korea's chemical weapons capabilities are highlighted, with estimates of stockpiles and production.

He said that one of two women believed to have rubbed the extremely toxic substance on Kim's face with their hands suffered from vomiting after the attack. The New York Times reports that VX agent can be created by mixing two compounds—and police suspect the two women put the substances on Kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose. The police chief said the airport where Kim was attacked is now being decontaminated. North Korea—which is widely suspected to have been behind the killing of leader Kim Jong Un's half brother—never signed the Chemical Weapons Convention that banned VX, the AP notes. Pyongyang denies involvement and says Malaysia's investigation is full of \"holes and contradictions.\" The father of one of the two women being held, Vietnamese citizen Doan Thi Huong, tells the Times his daughter trained as a pharmacist and he has seen little of her in recent years.

It mentions the cast, including Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, and others. The review points out that the film is a hybrid of old-school gothic horror and modern gore, which doesn't work well. The makeup by Rick Baker is criticized as campy, and the film's attempt to bridge the gap between classic and modern horror fails. The story is set in the 1890s in England, with Lawrence Talbot being cursed. The review also notes that the film is unnecessary and doesn't live up to the original, with some campiness and dated effects.\n\nPassage 2 seems to be a different review. It starts with a description of the film's eerie opening but then criticizes it as a \"toothless exercise in the obvious.\" The director, Joe Johnston, is praised for some visual elements but the film is seen as wasting potential. The review mentions that Benicio Del Toro's casting is a bad choice, and the film is compared to British crime series. There's also a mention of the original 1941 film and other werewolf movies like \"An American Werewolf in London.\" The review seems to be more negative, calling it a disappointment despite its visual beauty.\n\nPassage 3 is another review, more positive. It acknowledges the film's campy and enjoyable nature, comparing it to Frankenstein model kits. It mentions that the original Wolfman film wasn't great either, so the remake isn't really sullying ground. The director, Joe Johnston, and writers are praised for respecting the old clichés. The cast is noted, with Del Toro's appearance being a good fit for the role. The film is described as gory but more faithful to Universal horror tropes than other remakes.

{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of all the news passages provided. Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the key points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about BP's CEO, Bob Dudley, receiving a 20% pay increase to $19.6 million in 2015 despite the company's $5.2 billion loss. The author argues that Dudley's pay is justified because managing the company during low oil prices is harder, and he's handled challenges like the 2010 Gulf spill and cultural changes. The article mentions that his pay is compared to Shell's CEO, who had a significant drop in pay, and that Dudley's compensation includes pension and deferred bonuses.\n\nPassage 2 mentions that a shareholder advisory group criticized BP's decision to give maximum bonuses to executives, especially since the company had a poor performance year. The CEO's bonus increased, and the CFO also got 100% of his bonus. The company lost $5.2 billion, cut jobs, and faced shareholder dissent. Glass Lewis recommended against the pay, but it was approved by 86% of investors. The shareholder vote is scheduled for April 16.\n\nPassage 3 details the shareholder protest against Dudley's pay, with 59% voting against it, the first time in living memory for a top British company. This is part of a trend where investors are more aggressive about executive pay. Other companies like Smith & Nephew also faced similar rejections. The article notes that Dudley's pay was out of line compared to other energy CEOs who took pay cuts. The board is under pressure to reconsider, and some investors are calling for changes in corporate governance.\n\nPassage 5 summarizes the shareholder vote against the pay policy, with 59% rejecting it. BP may reduce dividends due to low oil prices. The chairman defends the pay as based on performance, but the company won't change Dudley's pay despite the vote. The summary also mentions the non-binding nature of the vote and the ongoing pressure on the board.\n\nNow, I need to consolidate these points into a coherent one-page summary. The main elements are: BP's CEO pay increase amid losses, shareholder opposition, reasons given by the company for the pay, comparisons with other executives, the non-binding vote results, and the implications for corporate governance and future policies.

The company had indicated earlier in the day that it may also have to reduce its dividend, the Wall Street Journal reports. Dudley is set to receive the full bonus he was eligible for, which comes to $4.2 million (including $1.4 million in cash and a portion in deferred BP shares), per an earlier MarketWatch report. This amount was bumped up from the $3 million ($1 million in cash) he received in 2014. BP's CFO was also on the list to rake in his full bonus. \"We think it sends the wrong message,\" a rep for shareholder Royal London Asset Management tells the BBC. \"It shows that the board is out of touch.\" Not only did BP suffer straight-up monetary losses as the price of oil fell, it also announced it will be getting rid of about 7,000 jobs and taking other belt-tightening measures. And the Financial Times notes that other energy company execs saw their pay slashed in 2015. But a BP spokesman says \"executives performed strongly in a difficult environment in 2015, managing the things they could control and for which they were accountable.\" Andy Critchlow, writing for the Reuters Breakingviews blog, agrees. \"Dudley has to work harder than his predecessors,\" he writes, noting the CEO has helped the company recover from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster and improved safety protocol. \"The mild-mannered American has had possibly the toughest job in the oil industry. His rewards look in line with that task.\" Carl-Henric Svanberg, chairman of BP's board, says the nonbinding shareholder vote won't alter the payouts they've already decided on, but that the board will take investors' concerns into account when coming up with next year's compensation packages."], "all_classes": null, "length": 3225}

He claimed to have caught a gang of serial killers called Pishtacos, who were extracting fat from victims as part of an ancient Andean legend. The police initially said up to 60 people were murdered, and their fat was sold to Italian cosmetics makers. However, it turned out there was only one victim, linked to the cocaine trade. The police displayed human fat in a bottle of Inca Kola and showed a video of body parts. But later, the investigation was called a botch, and the police chief admitted embarrassment. The regional police in Huanuco said they were excluded from the inquiry and found only one victim. Experts criticized the police for using the myth to explain the crime and for scaring tourists. Doctors and anthropologists pointed out the impracticality of selling human fat and the misuse of the legend.\n\nPassage 2 seems to be a similar story but with some differences in details.

He should know: Brook currently is trekking the 2,650-mile PCT, which runs from the Mexican border through California, Oregon, and Washington to the border with Canada. But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2870}

While attempting to descend the mountain, Gary was looking at an Ordnance Survey app while Jane went a short way ahead to make sure the path was safe, according to the Telegraph. The Manchester Evening News reports Gary heard his wife fall, got to safety, and called for help. Rescuers found the 53-year-old librarian's body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff with a fractured skull. At a hearing Friday, Jane's was ruled an accidental death due, in part, to using an app instead of a map. \"Apart from potential difficulties caused by poor detail on an electronic map, batteries on mobile phones have a nasty habit of running out just when you need them most,\" the Telegraph quotes a spokesperson for Mountain Rescue England and Wales as saying. A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about Seattle's soda tax, which was implemented in 2018. The tax is 1.75 cents per ounce on sweetened beverages. The former mayor, Ed Murray, supported it for reducing sugar consumption, funding community college, and subsidizing healthy foods. However, the passage criticizes the tax, pointing out that it didn't achieve its goals. Cook County, Illinois, repealed its soda tax after public backlash, and similar issues happened in Philadelphia. The tax is seen as regressive, hurting low-income families, and causing businesses to lose revenue. Retailers like Costco are directing customers to out-of-city stores to avoid the tax, leading to decreased revenue for Seattle.\n\nPassage 2 focuses on the impact on Costco. The tax caused a significant price increase for Gatorade, leading to signs directing customers to other locations. The tax is criticized for being regressive and inconsistent, as it excludes milk-based drinks. Some residents are upset, and there's a call for consistency in applying the tax to all sugary drinks and fast food.\n\nPassage 3 discusses the repeal of Cook County's soda tax. The tax was costly for businesses like vending machine companies and led to a decline in sales. Retailers and big soda companies opposed the tax, leading to its repeal. Sales dropped in affected areas, and there was a shift to neighboring counties. The tax didn't help health outcomes and burdened small businesses. Similar taxes exist in other places, but Cook County's was particularly controversial.\n\nPassage 4 mentions a bill to bring the soda tax statewide in Washington. The tax would add nearly two cents per ounce. Some businesses in Spokane are concerned about the impact, as the tax could increase costs. However, some residents support the tax for health reasons. Seattle expects to make $15 million from the tax, which will fund healthy meals for low-income families.\n\nPassage 5 is a more critical take on the Seattle tax. It argues that the tax didn't reduce soda consumption and instead drove people to buy outside the city, reducing revenue. Costco's response with price signs and directing customers is highlighted. The passage criticizes the inconsistency in public health messaging and the regressive nature of the tax. It also mentions the \"frog in a boiling pot\" analogy, suggesting that sudden price hikes are ineffective. The tax's failure", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Defense attorneys argued that ballistic tests and phone records cast doubt on the prosecution’s case, asserting that Merritt was “no", "answers": ["A judge on Tuesday allowed a man charged in freeway shootings that rattled Phoenix last year to be released from jail amid questions about evidence authorities say links him to the crimes. The judge overseeing the case of Leslie Merritt Jr. reduced his bond to zero and said he can return to his home under electronic monitoring, the AP reports. He was expected to be released later in the day. The reduction of the bond—once $1 million—was a major victory as defense lawyers contend that ballistic tests cast doubt on the claim by authorities that Merritt was behind four of the freeway shootings. \"With all due respect your honor, there's no evidence against him to show he's responsible for this,\" defense lawyer Jason Lamm said. \"He is no more the I-10 shooter than, respectfully, you are.\" Merritt lifted up his shackled arms in celebration as he walked from the courtroom. After the hearing, family members hugged and shook the hands of defense lawyers. Merritt has pleaded not guilty to drive-by shooting, aggravated assault, and other charges. The shootings caused panic on Phoenix-area freeways, where 11 vehicles were hit in August and September. Detectives took Merritt into custody on Sept. 18; in court the next day, Merritt adamantly denied shooting any cars, telling the judge, \"I'm the wrong guy.\" His lawyers immediately began raising questions about the evidence, citing ballistics information and phone records they say provided an alibi for their client. (Also Tuesday, a motorist suspected of shooting at other vehicles on an Alabama highway died after a shootout with officers.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 955}

The sheriff mentioned she was a disgruntled employee and had a security guard background. The gun was a 9mm Glock, legally purchased. The incident happened on Thursday, and there were three victims in the hospital. The area is near Aberdeen, and there were other shootings in the US that day. The governor and other officials are involved, and the FBI and ATF are assisting. The area is a business park with other companies like Clorox and Zenith Freight. The community is affected, with people being evacuated and a family reunification center set up.\n\nPassage 2 seems to repeat some of the same information but adds more details. It mentions the same shooter, Snochia Moseley, and the same number of victims. The timeline is similar: shots fired at 9:06 a.m., police arrived quickly. The motive is unknown. The company, Rite Aid, closed the facility, and they're assessing when to reopen. There's mention of a family reunification center, the response from law enforcement, and the impact on the community. Also, there's a reference to a previous shooting at an Edgewood granite company last year. The witness accounts and the chaos in the area are highlighted, along with the nearby schools and businesses.\n\nNow, I need to combine these details into a concise summary.

The study involved 64,000 children and their mothers. They found that frequent use was associated with a 29% higher risk of ADHD diagnosis and 37% for hyperkinetic syndrome. However, the study doesn't prove causation, and experts like Dr. Ritz and Dr. Chapa suggest avoiding chronic use but not necessarily stopping it entirely. They mention that other factors like infections or genetic predispositions might play a role. The FDA has limited doses, and Tylenol's manufacturer says there's no proven causal link.\n\nPassage 2 is similar but more concise. It also mentions the Danish study, the same findings about ADHD-like behaviors, and the lack of causation. It notes that longer use and later in pregnancy increase risk. The study didn't consider dosage, and the manufacturer again states no proven link. Dr. Wiznitzer cautions against assuming causation, and Dr. Chapa suggests non-pharmacological alternatives.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a coherent summary.

The risk increased the later in pregnancy the drug was taken and the longer it was taken. Women who used acetaminophen for 20 weeks or longer had a 50% higher chance of their children being prescribed ADHD medication.

The context includes the recent mid-term elections where Democrats lost control of the House, and there's speculation about her potential candidacy. She's also in New Zealand, which has had female leaders, and the tour ends in Australia.\n\nPassage 2 seems to be a follow-up. It mentions that Clinton addressed speculation about another run, confirming she's happy as Secretary of State. However, it's noted that her comments might not definitively rule out a 2016 run since she might not be in that position then. There's a mention of a slip-up by New Zealand's PM John Key who mistakenly called her \"President Clinton,\" which she might have been careful about. She also defended Obama and the Democrats' losses, saying it's part of historical patterns and that Obama's policies were necessary despite not being popular.\n\nPassage 3 is about her visit to New Zealand where PM Key accidentally referred to her as \"President Clinton,\" leading to laughter and applause.

It points out the lack of certain elements from the novel, like the rape, and the focus on the killer and the father's grief. The review also mentions the CGI-heavy heaven scenes and the underperformance of Susan Sarandon's character.\n\nPassage 4 is a brief summary with some details about the movie's rating, cast, and director.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The company disclosed the breach late last week, mentioning that they first noticed suspicious activity in mid-December. They said some customers' payment cards were used fraudulently, but they didn't have Social Security numbers or birth dates. They defended their delayed disclosure, saying they waited for confirmation. The breach lasted longer than Target's, but Target's breach involved more data. Neiman didn't link their breach to Target's. They offered free credit monitoring. State attorneys general are investigating both breaches, possibly linked to Eastern European groups.\n\nPassage 2 is about the Target breach. A report from iSight details the malware used, which was placed in POS systems. The malware was sophisticated, using memory scraping to capture unencrypted card data during authorization. The report mentions regions like Eastern Europe and Brazil with coding skills. It doesn't name the perpetrators but notes the malware's effectiveness and the trend of such attacks. The report warns of more breaches due to the low risk and high reward.\n\nPassage 3 mentions that the Target breach was part of a broader international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report from federal and private investigators was sent to financial services and retailers, indicating the breach's scale and sophistication.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. Start with the main events: both Target and Neiman Marcus had breaches. Target's breach was larger, affecting 40 million credit/debit cards and 70 million with other info. Neiman's breach started in July, took longer to contain, but didn't steal as much data. Both were linked to Eastern Europe. Target's breach was part of a larger campaign. The iSight report explains the malware used, its sophistication, and the regions involved. Both companies faced criticism for delayed disclosures. Neiman's delay was criticized as timing with the holiday season, but they claimed it was due to investigation. Both offered credit monitoring. State AGs are investigating possible connections.

The incident happened because the lion attacked a man, and the rangers had to act quickly. There's mention of the lion's escape due to a faulty fence and the debate over whether to tranquilize or kill the lion. Also, there's a similar situation in South Africa with a lion named Sylvester escaping from Karoo National Park, leading to discussions about relocation versus killing.\n\nPassage 2 gives more details about Mohawk. It describes the public outrage over his death, the circumstances of his attack on a boda boda rider, and the fact that he was a famous lion. There's mention of the crowd surrounding him, the lack of tranquilizers initially, and the decision by rangers to shoot him. The passage also notes that Mohawk was part of a pride and had a companion. There's a mention of the population growth around the park and the encroachment on the park's area.\n\nPassage 4 adds more context about the Nairobi National Park's issues, like the electric fence and the south side being unfenced. It also talks about other lion escapes in recent weeks and the public's role in taking selfies with the lions, which complicates recapture efforts. The South African lion Sylvester is mentioned again, with the public's attempt to save him and the government's consideration of different options.\n\nNow, I need to consolidate all these points into a coherent summary. The main events are the deaths of Mohawk and Sylvester, the reasons behind their escapes (fencing issues, habitat loss), the public and conservationist reactions, and the broader context of lion conservation challenges. I should mention the debate over killing vs. tranquilizing, the impact of urban expansion on the park, and the international context with the IUCN status of lions.\n\nI need to make sure the summary is concise, covers all key points without getting too detailed, and flows logically.

Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN.

His father, SSP Francis Manana Nabugyere, mentions that the child was at the staff quarters with a maid when the leopard attacked. The mother was away. They recovered the skull and bones, and the child was buried. The father is seeking compensation from UWA and wants better security. UWA's Bashir Hangi says they're tracking the leopard and considering relocation.\n\nPassage 2 is similar but mentions the child is three years old. The toddler was left with a nanny at the unfenced staff quarters. The nanny wasn't aware the child followed her outside. The leopard took the child, and the search found the skull the next day. Hangi says they're hunting the leopard because it's dangerous after eating human flesh. They plan to capture and relocate it.\n\nPassage 3 repeats the details, confirming the child is two years old, attacked in the kitchen by the leopard. The mother is a ranger, and the nanny tried to save the child but failed. The remains were found, and the father expects compensation. It's noted as a rare incident in Uganda, and UWA has had other recent issues like lion deaths and a tourist fatality.

They also found a 10th-century Bulgarian royal seal. Milen Nikolov, the museum director, calls it one of the most important discoveries. The vessel is decorated with crosses and is very small. The reliquary was part of an early Christian basilica, and the ashes were believed to have healing properties. The site was a pilgrimage spot for early Christians.\n\nPassage 2 is more detailed. It mentions the same discovery but adds context about the location being the ancient port of Burgos (Poros) on Cape Foros. The reliquary was found during 2014 excavations and announced in 2015. Nikolov explains that a pilgrim from the area might have brought the relic back from Ephesus, where John the Apostle's grave is. The reliquary is a tiny lead tube with cross decorations, different from other known lead tubes. They mention other similar reliquaries found in Italy, Spain, Germany, and the US, but this one is linked to Ephesus because of the imagery. There's also a mention of another relic discovery in 2010 on St. John Island with St. John the Baptist's relics, which were authenticated by Oxford University.

Astronomers at the California Institute of Technology say a giant celestial body \"lurking at the end of our solar system,\" as the Washington Post puts it, may actually be a planet, and they're even already calling it \"Planet Nine.\" In their research published in the Astronomical Journal, the sky-watching scientists—one of whom is known as the \"Pluto killer\" for his role in getting Pluto demoted—think their find is five to 10 times as massive as Earth, and per the AP, almost as big as Neptune and orbiting billions of miles past that planet's orbit. Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says. Not everyone's convinced. \"I have seen many, many such claims in my career,\" a planetary scientist at Colorado's Southwest Research Institute tells Nature. \"And all of them have been wrong.\" (The Washington Post caught up with Brown for a Q&A on the latest Pluto-killing endeavor.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4933}

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds. This doesn't pinpoint a cause, as pre-existing heart problems could be the culprit, but researchers hope to study this correlation further.

It mentions that one in seven patients is under 50, which challenges the traditional view that it's mainly an older man's disease. The study from the University of Michigan suggests that current screening guidelines starting at 50 might be too late. Symptoms are often subtle, and colonoscopies or stool tests are recommended. The study by Dr. Samantha Hendren found that younger patients have more advanced disease but better survival rates. They also note that younger patients are more likely to get aggressive treatments like surgery and radiation.\n\nPassage 2 is similar but more detailed. It also mentions the same statistics about 15% under 50. The study by Hendren's team using SEER data shows that younger patients have more advanced stages (regional or distant) and better survival rates. The five-year survival rates are higher for younger patients even with advanced disease. The authors suggest that screening guidelines need to be reconsidered, especially since breast cancer screening starts at 40 with lower incidence in younger women. The source is a 2016 Cancer journal article.\n\nPassage 3 is from Reuters Health, reinforcing the same findings. It states that by 2030, nearly a quarter of rectal cancers and over 10% of colon cancers will be in under-50s. The study found that younger patients are more likely to have metastatic disease and receive more aggressive treatments. Survival rates are better for younger patients despite advanced stages. The study's limitations include lack of family history data and possible selection bias. Experts like Dr. Hecht and Dr. Winawer comment on the need for vigilance in diagnosing symptoms and the uncertainty about changing screening guidelines.\n\nPassage 4 is from HealthDay News, again highlighting the rise in colon cancer under 50. Dr. Hendren notes that younger patients are often diagnosed after symptoms appear, which is why they have more advanced stages. The study found that younger patients had higher survival rates, possibly due to aggressive treatment. The report mentions that while the risk is low, there's debate on whether to lower screening age. Dr. Chan suggests environmental factors might be involved, and the study's data is from 1998-2011.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the key points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about a discovery in southern Australia, specifically a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, where a human settlement dating back 49,000 years was found. The discovery was made by archaeologist Giles Hamm and an Aboriginal elder, Clifford Coulthard. The site has rock art, evidence of fire use, and tools. They found 4,300 objects and 200 bone fragments. The site's age was determined by scientists, and it suggests that humans might have arrived in Australia earlier than previously thought, possibly 55,000 to 60,000 years ago. There's also mention of interaction with megafauna like Diprotodon, with bones of juvenile animals indicating hunting.\n\nPassage 2 details the excavation methods used at Warratyi rock shelter. They used a grid system, sieves, and careful documentation. They found 1,070 stone artifacts, and refitting them helped determine the stratigraphy. The site has megafauna remains and human artifacts together, which challenges the climate change theory for megafauna extinction. Professor Prideaux mentions that this site is well-dated and stratified, supporting human interaction with megafauna. The elders' stories about the shelters were also mentioned, showing cultural significance.\n\nPassage 4 (since the user listed Passage 4, even though the original had Passage 2 and 4) discusses the discovery of ancient artifacts in the Warratyi rock shelter, dated to 49,000 years ago. This suggests humans arrived in the arid interior 10,000 years earlier than thought. The site includes tools, ochre, and evidence of interaction with megafauna. The debate about the dating methods and the significance of local innovation versus external influences is mentioned. The study challenges Eurocentric views of Indigenous Australian technology and is published in Nature.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. The main points are the discovery of the Warratyi site, its age, the methods used, the artifacts found, the implications for human migration and interaction with megafauna, and the cultural significance. Also, mention the debate over dating and the impact on understanding Indigenous Australian history.\n\nI should structure the summary with an introduction about the discovery, then details", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

They have strict guidelines, limiting questions to her Vegas residency, new single, and album. The radio stations are told not to ask personal questions. However, some interviews ended up being problematic, like the one with Roula and Ryan where it was a one-sided conversation. There's also mention of Spears possibly lip-syncing in her Vegas show, which she denies. Additionally, there's a mention of her \"Work Bitch\" video where she appears slimmer in the final edit. Then there are other celebrity news items: Martha Stewart's comments about cleanliness, Beyoncé's Instagram post, Charlie Hunnam's issues with \"50 Shades of Grey,\" Arnold Schwarzenegger's activities, Elvis Duran and Eric Trump's charity walk, and the extension of the \"Bayside! The Musical\" show. There's also a mention of other celebrities like Rod Stewart, Arctic Monkeys, A$AP Rocky, Haylie Duff, Ne-Yo, Jamie Foxx, and Bobby Flay and Guy Fieri.\n\nPassage 2 focuses on Britney Spears' conservatorship. Her father, Jamie Spears, has been managing her life since 2008. He's now asking for more money, specifically an increase in his monthly payment from $16,000 to $18,000, and an additional $800 for office rent. He also wants to increase the office expense from $1,200 to $2,000 per month.

The death tolls are mentioned: 56 Israeli soldiers and 3 civilians killed, while in Gaza, over 1,360 Palestinians dead and 6,500 wounded. Palestinian President Abbas declared Gaza a humanitarian disaster and accused Israel of war crimes. There's a mention of a 72-hour ceasefire agreed upon by Israel and Hamas, starting on Friday, with the UN and US involved. However, there are conflicting reports about the ceasefire's terms, like Israeli forces staying in place. Also, there are updates about the ceasefire being a \"lull of opportunity\" by Kerry, and some incidents like the UN school attacks and the White House's response. There's also a mention of a pro-Israel rally in Paris and some internal Israeli political statements about the conflict.\n\nPassage 2 starts with displaced Palestinians in a UN school. Netanyahu says Israel will destroy Hamas tunnels regardless of a ceasefire. The military has called up more reservists. The death tolls are similar: over 1,300 Palestinians and 50 Israelis. There are attacks on UN schools, leading to international condemnation. The UN and US criticize the attacks. There's a mention of the ceasefire efforts stalling, with Egypt and Israel discussing conditions. Hamas wants the border blockade lifted.

They're closing the pop-up and will continue with Snapbots. There's a limit of 6 pairs per household, and accessories are sold directly. The company acknowledges that Spectacles haven't generated significant revenue yet but hope to use them to boost user engagement. They also mention the charging case that melted and the positive user feedback. The strategy of not giving developers first access avoided the Google Glass stigma. The main goal is to use Spectacles to get more people creating content for Snapchat, which could help their IPO.\n\nPassage 4 confirms the same info as Passage 1 and 3. Spectacles are now available online, three colors, $130, shipping in the U.S. only. They mention the previous vending machine approach and the resale on eBay.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

Then she started having recurring infections, including a UTI that led to a severe kidney infection. The bacteria was a resistant strain of Pseudomonas. She was diagnosed with stage 3 kidney reflux, which means her left kidney isn't functioning well. She's scheduled for surgery to fix the reflux and remove part of the kidney. Also, she has heart issues like ASD and pulmonary stenosis, which will be addressed after the surgery. The family is grateful and mentions their faith.\n\nPassage 2 explains what a Pseudomonas infection is. It's caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is common but can be dangerous for people with weakened immune systems. It's hard to treat because it's antibiotic-resistant. It can cause infections in various parts of the body, like the lungs, urinary tract, or bloodstream. Symptoms vary depending on the infection site, and it can be life-threatening if it spreads.\n\nPassage 3 talks about an Oklahoma infant, Oakleigh Nance, who is fighting a \"super strain\" of E. coli. She's 11 months old and had been in and out of the hospital due to kidney issues. She recently contracted a critical E. coli infection that's resistant to many antibiotics because of her prior antibiotic use.

Let me start by reading each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 is about Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney's performance in the CPAC straw poll. Santorum didn't do well, getting 38% to Romney's 31%. Santorum claims that Romney might have rigged the poll by buying tickets, but Romney's campaign denies this. Santorum says they didn't pay for turnout, and he doesn't want to engage in that kind of politics. The Romney campaign calls Santorum's statements untrue.\n\nPassage 2 is Ron Paul reacting to Romney's self-description as a \"severe conservative.\" Paul is confused by the term and asks Romney to clarify what it means. He seems skeptical, implying that Romney's claim might not be genuine.\n\nPassage 3 is about President Obama's birth control policy and Jack Lew's comments. Lew says Obama's position has been consistent and that the accommodation is the extent they'll go to please the bishops. He also mentions that insurance companies would pay less for birth control-inclusive plans because they reduce pregnancies, which is a bit surprising given the context of Catholic institutions.\n\nNow, I need to condense all this into a one-page summary. Let me structure it by each main topic. Start with the CPAC straw poll and the Santorum vs. Romney debate. Then mention Ron Paul's reaction to Romney's conservative label. Finally, cover Obama's birth control policy and Lew's comments. I should make sure to connect the points and keep it concise, avoiding too much detail.

Santorum, appearing groggy and in a suit without a sweater vest, criticized Romney’s victory, suggesting the latter may have \"rigged\" the poll by purchasing tickets to boost turnout—a tactic Santorum claimed his campaign avoided.

It talks about the EPA and Magnolia Homes (which is Magnolia Waco Properties, LLC) settling a case related to violations of the TSCA RRP Rule. The main issue is that their renovations on Fixer Upper didn't follow lead-safe practices. The settlement includes a $40,000 civil penalty, compliance measures, public education, and a $160,000 lead-abatement project in Waco. They also have to create educational content. The EPA found noncompliance in 33 properties. Magnolia cooperated and took steps to comply, like getting certified and training staff. The RRP Rule is about preventing lead exposure during renovations of pre-1978 homes. The health effects of lead are mentioned, and the prevalence of lead-based paint in homes.\n\nPassage 2 is shorter. It mentions the same $40,000 fine, the 33 homes, and that the EPA noticed the violations by reviewing the show. It also notes the educational video and the $160k abatement project. The tone is a bit more casual, mentioning the EPA having a department that watches renovation shows.\n\nPassage 3 is similar to Passage 1 but more concise. It confirms the $40k fine, the settlement details, the educational video, the $160k project, and the 33 properties. It also mentions the EPA's attention from the TV show and Magnolia's cooperation. The March 21 episode where they discussed lead paint is highlighted, along with Chip's social media efforts.\n\nNow, I need to combine all these into a one-page summary. The key elements are:\n\n- Magnolia Homes (Chip and Joanna Gaines) settled with EPA over lead paint violations.\n- The violations involved not following RRP Rule during renovations on Fixer Upper.\n- 33 properties were found noncompliant.\n- Civil penalty of $40k, plus $160k for a lead-abatement project in Waco.\n- Educational efforts: video by Chip, public awareness campaigns.\n- Magnolia took steps to comply, including certification and training.\n- EPA's role in reviewing the show and the impact of lead paint on health.\n- The RRP Rule's purpose to prevent lead exposure during renovations.\n\n", "answers": ["Fixer Upper stars Chip and Joanna Gaines are having to pay up for EPA violations seen on their hit HGTV show.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 seems to be a note about spreading the word about Science, but it's not really news. Maybe it's just a form or a disclaimer. I can probably ignore this one since it's not relevant to the actual news content.\n\nPassage 2 is about discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya related to Middle Stone Age tools and climate changes. The key points here are that these tools are the oldest found, dating back 320,000 years, and they suggest that climate shifts drove toolmaking advances and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives. The tools were made from obsidian from distant locations, indicating trade. Also, there's mention of red pigment, which might have been used for symbolic purposes. The researchers link these changes to climate variability, which forced hominins to adapt by moving more and developing new technologies.\n\nPassage 3 is a more detailed account of the same findings, emphasizing the innovative tools and the role of environmental stress in fostering social networks. It mentions the hand axes as \"Swiss army knives\" and the Middle Stone Age beginning earlier than thought. The researchers suggest that repeated natural disasters and climate changes pushed early humans to form alliances and trade, which helped their survival. The tools found in Olorgesailie show a shift from large hand axes to smaller, more specialized tools, indicating technological progress.\n\nPassage 4 discusses the broader implications of these findings, challenging the previous belief that the \"human revolution\" (the emergence of modern behaviors like art and symbolism) happened around 40,000-50,000 years ago. The new studies show that such behaviors, like the use of obsidian and ochre, date back to 300,000 years ago. This suggests that the development of modern human traits started earlier in Africa, possibly linked to climate changes. The passage also mentions that the transition from Early to Middle Stone Age tools coincides with the evolution of Homo sapiens, but it's not certain if these tools are directly tied to our species. There's a gap in the evidence, and other sites show that both archaic and modern humans used similar tools, complicating the timeline.\n\nNow, I need to synthesize all these points into a concise one-page summary. The main themes are the discovery of ancient tools in Kenya", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The Australian authorities are coordinating the search, and they mention that up to 10 military planes, two civil aircraft, and 13 ships are involved. The signals detected by the Chinese ship are at a frequency of 37.5kHz, which matches the black box pingers. However, there's no confirmation yet that these signals are from MH370. They also mention that the batteries on the black boxes are expected to die soon, so time is critical. There are some white objects spotted near the area, but they haven't been linked to the plane. The Australian official, Angus Houston, says the signals are a \"lead\" but to be cautious.

The author, who has attended Apple keynotes since 1998, is critical of this move. They mention that Phil Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, used the term \"courage\" to justify the removal, which the author finds ridiculous. The author argues that this decision is not about technological advancement but rather about Apple's proprietary systems and profit motives.\n\nIn Passage 1, the author compares the removal of the headphone jack to past changes like the CD drive and 30-pin connector, but insists this is worse. They criticize the lack of a technological justification, pointing out that wired audio is better than wireless. The author also mentions the inconvenience of using dongles and the loss of compatibility with existing devices. There's a mention of the AirPods and their issues, like being easy to lose and expensive. The author also mocks Apple's claim about space constraints and the Taptic engine, suggesting that most users don't even know what that is.

Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

They're reducing the number of boarding lanes from five to two, which should reduce congestion and speed up boarding. They mention that this change has been tested in Chicago and Houston and is now official. Priority passengers like elites and Chase cardholders are in group 2, and there are push notifications for app users. They also compare this to other airlines like American and Delta, noting that United's top tier can pre-board before the official process starts.\n\nPassage 2 is about a joint business agreement between United, Copa, and Avianca. They're creating a revenue-sharing partnership to offer more routes, nonstop flights, and better service between the US and 19 Latin American countries. The goal is to increase competition, reduce travel times, and improve customer experience. They need government approval and are looking into adding Brazil to the agreement.\n\nPassage 3 mentions that United is addressing overcrowding at gates due to fuller flights. They reduced boarding lines to two and are using mobile notifications to avoid gate congestion. They also note that customers have complained about the previous system, leading to long lines and delays. The new process aims to make boarding more efficient and on time.\n\nPassage 4 details the new two-lane boarding process with color-coded lanes (blue and green). It explains the groups (1-5) and how each group boards. They mention testing since last fall and rolling out to all gates. It also compares to other airlines like American and Delta, and Southwest's system. There's a mention of customer feedback leading to the change and potential issues with elite passengers grouping together.\n\nNow, I need to consolidate these points into a coherent summary.

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated. More than a decade later, he was still part of the Hooper family—but he wanted to make it official by asking the Hoopers to adopt him right before his 30th birthday. “He said he wanted to honor us, and it was a big honor,\" Hooper tells Today. \"I’ve always known he loved me, but this really showed he loved us.” The adoption went through in 1998, but Cruz \"was my son from the day I kept him,” Hooper says.

He's accusing The New York Times of fabricating stories and not covering his rallies properly. He mentions that if the media covered him honestly, he'd beat Hillary Clinton by 20%. There's also mention of him threatening to take away reporters' credentials and his rally where he called the newspaper \"going to hell.\"\n\nPassage 2 covers Trump's campaign plans, like ending nation-building and focusing on counterterrorism, including a new immigration policy with a religious freedom test. Also, Vice President Biden is criticizing Trump as the most uninformed nominee, and Hillary Clinton is trying to mobilize undocumented immigrants (DREAMERS) against Trump's deportation promises. There's also mention of Trump's campaign chairman blaming the media for focusing on his controversial comments instead of his economic plan.\n\nPassage 3 seems to be a continuation of Trump's media criticism, with a note that the author acknowledges the media's bias towards Republicans but points out that Trump's situation is different.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

People found with 2 ounces or less of marijuana will now simply receive a ticket—not a crime on their record—and cultivation of five plants or fewer is now allowed. A licensing agency was also established to oversee pot cultivation and distribution for medical and scientific efforts. Rastafarians are rejoicing, because the bill also grants them the legal right to use cannabis for sacramental purposes, while tourists who have medical marijuana prescriptions elsewhere can pay for permits to buy a bit of ganja on the island. Jamaica has shied away from decriminalization because it didn't want to risk violating international treaties and provoking US sanctions, the Guardian reports. The process for the new law was described by National Security Minister Peter Bunting as an \"elephantine,\" nearly 40-year effort, ABC Australia reports. \"[The law] eliminates an unnecessary source of friction between police and citizens, and ensures that our young people are not gratuitously shackled with criminal records,\" he said in a statement.

The study used infrared telescopes to map water isotopes, showing that deuterium concentration indicates water loss. The ocean likely existed for millions of years before thinning atmosphere caused it to recede and freeze. The current ice caps hold 13% of the original ocean. The search for life is ongoing, with the Exomars rover planned for 2018. Methane detected by Curiosity is speculated but not confirmed as biological.\n\nPassage 3 reinforces the findings from Passage 2. It mentions that Earth and Mars initially had similar H/D ratios, but Mars lost ordinary hydrogen, leading to higher deuterium. The analysis of water vapor shows an ancient ocean covering a fifth of the planet, with enough water to form a 137m deep layer. The study by Villanueva and others suggests the minimum water amount, but Kasting thinks there might be more. The conclusion is that Mars was once much wetter and warmer, supporting the possibility of past life.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. Start with the main findings: ancient ocean, water loss, D/H ratios, implications for habitability. Mention the methods used (telescopes, isotopic analysis). Include the depth and coverage of the ocean, comparison to Earth's oceans, and the current state of water. Also, touch on the implications for life and future missions.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

In 2014, Jumaah sent her a text message saying he wouldn't finish his thesis if he didn't return to Sweden within a week. He was in Iraq with his family, hiding in a bleach factory because ISIS had taken over their village, killing men and enslaving women. Jumaah had gone to Iraq to protect his family after his wife called him. Turner was determined to help and contacted the university's security chief, Per Gustafson. They arranged a rescue with armed mercenaries, and Jumaah and his family were saved. They later completed his PhD and he works in a pharmaceutical company now. The university helped pay for the rescue, and Gustafson said no other university had done something like this.\n\nPassage 2 is a similar story but with some details. It mentions that Jumaah returned to Iraq for a family wedding, stayed behind to finish his work, but then his family was in danger. ISIS attacked Sinjar, killing Yazidis. Jumaah tried to get back but couldn't because borders were closed. He and his family hid in a bleach factory. Turner called him, heard he was in danger, and started looking for a rescue. She approached the security chief, who found a company to rescue them. The rescue was done by armed mercenaries, and they were taken to Erbil Airport. Jumaah felt guilty leaving his family behind but survived. The family survived, he finished his PhD, and the university helped with the costs.\n\nNow, I need to combine these two passages into a concise summary.

This passage highlights the creative process behind the movie's sounds, which are fictional but inspired by real animals.\n\nPassage 3 seems to be about web collections by Mark Graham, but it doesn't provide any new information related to the other passages. I can probably skip this one since it's just about the source of the data.\n\nPassage 4 is a scientific study discussing closed-mouth vocalizations in birds. It explains that these sounds are used in territorial or courtship displays and are more common in larger birds. The study suggests that non-avian dinosaurs might have had this ability too, given their large body sizes. It also mentions that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved independently multiple times in different lineages.\n\nPassage 5 is another part of the study mentioned in Passage 1. It reinforces the idea that dinosaurs might have made closed-mouth sounds, similar to birds. The research uses statistical analysis of bird species to infer dinosaur vocalizations. The study also notes that the ability to make these sounds is linked to body size and that it's possible some dinosaurs used this for mating displays.

A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The group’s $50,000 donation in 1933 helped build the dorm. A state appeals court ruled the building could be renamed Memorial Hall only after Vanderbilt gave the United Daughters back their money—$1.2 million in today’s dollars. The university has the cash, thanks to a raft of anonymous contributors who wanted the tie to America’s painful past broken for good. \"It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,\" Zeppos told the Tennessean. \"And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.” Yet tampering with Confederate imagery remains controversial, and a new state law makes it harder to do so, the AP reports.

There was a previous failed attempt by ICE and Nasdaq to acquire NYSE Euronext, which was blocked by the Justice Department. The current merger might face fewer antitrust issues because ICE focuses on commodities, while NYSE Euronext is in stocks and derivatives.

The main points are that the PS4 is a next-gen platform focusing on flexibility, allowing gamers to play anywhere. Mark Cerny, the lead architect, mentions that the development started five years ago, building on the PS3's foundation but addressing its limitations. They emphasize ease of development with an x86 CPU, which is a shift from the PS3's system-on-a-chip. The DualShock 4 controller has a touchpad and 3D camera, similar to Kinect. Features like save states, background downloading, and social functions are highlighted. The PS4 is described as an advanced PC for developers, making game creation easier.\n\nPassage 2 provides more technical details. The PS4 is a PC with an x86 processor, 8-core CPU/GPU, 8GB GDDR5 memory, and an HDD. Graphics demos show improved visuals compared to PS3 but not a revolutionary leap. There's no backward compatibility with PS3, but PlayStation Cloud allows streaming old games. The DualShock 4 has a touchpad, share button, headphone jack, and light bar for movement tracking. Background downloading and instant boot from sleep are features. Social features include live streaming, sharing gameplay, and integration with Facebook.

They developed an algorithm that matched neural patterns to the videos, creating a continuous, abstract reconstruction. The key point is that this is the first time dynamic visual experiences are being reconstructed, not just static images. They mention it's a step towards reading minds, including dreams and thoughts. The lead author, Shinji Nishimoto, compares the experience to watching a movie.\n\nPassage 2 seems similar but adds more details. It also mentions UC Berkeley researchers reconstructing videos from brain activity, possibly leading to understanding dreams, memories, and fantasies. Jack Gallant, a professor, is quoted about the significance of this leap. The process involves using fMRI data to create a model that maps brain activity to video features. The reconstructed videos are blurry because they combine multiple YouTube clips matching the brain patterns. Gallant mentions the brain's complexity with multiple modules and the need for more models for better resolution.

The article mentions that this is a symbolic move by House Republicans, led by Kevin McCarthy, to honor Armstrong, the first man on the moon. However, the context is that the House Republicans are not focusing on major legislative issues but are instead engaging in procedural activities. The passage also discusses the sequestration, which is a series of automatic spending cuts. The Republicans are avoiding taking action to prevent these cuts, preferring the sequester over other spending cuts or tax increases. President Obama is pushing for alternative solutions, but Republicans are resistant. The House has been in session for only a few days, with many pro forma sessions. The renaming bill was passed with a voice vote, but some Democrats criticized the irony of renaming while cutting NASA's budget.\n\nPassage 2 is more of a commentary piece. The author states that politicians no longer scare them, having survived past crises. The focus is on the sequester, which is supposed to be a severe cut but doesn't affect congressional salaries. The author points out that while many programs will be cut, the salaries of lawmakers remain untouched.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

The House Benghazi report found that the administration's focus was more on the cause of the attack rather than rescue plans. They also mention that the military wasn't deployed, and the State Department denied that clothing issues affected the response.\n\nPassage 2 is about the final report from the Benghazi Select Committee. The majority report, authored by Republicans, includes a timeline showing discrepancies between public and private statements by officials like Hillary Clinton. The report claims the administration provided a false narrative, blaming the attack on an anti-Islam video when it was actually a terrorist attack. There are private emails and calls where officials acknowledged it was a terrorist attack, but public statements contradicted that. Clinton's statements were criticized for misleading the public, and the report suggests she and others knew better but didn't correct the misinformation.\n\nPassage 3 seems to be about the Internet Archive's efforts to preserve web pages and fix broken links.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.
