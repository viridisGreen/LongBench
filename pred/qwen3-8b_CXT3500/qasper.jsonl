However, it doesn't specify the exact number of sentences or the total number of sentences in the dataset. \n\nIn the \"Approach\" section under \"Features ::: Word embeddings,\" there's a mention of the corpus used", "answers": ["3606", "6946"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2835}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking which models or frameworks the authors compare their proposed method to. I need to check the article to find any mentions of comparisons with existing models.\n\nLooking through the article, the introduction mentions that deep neural networks like CNNs and RNNs have been successful in various tasks. However, the main focus of the paper is on their new approach called s2sL. \n\nIn the experiments section, they validate their approach on two tasks using the GTZAN dataset. They mention using an MLP as the base classifier and describe the s2s-MLP architecture. But do they", "answers": ["MLP", "Eusboost, MWMOTE"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2474}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if their NER model learns from both text and images. I need to check the article to find out.\n\nLooking through the article, the introduction mentions that they build upon state-of-the-art neural architectures and propose using auxiliary modalities like images and text. The methods section talks about their model taking input from both image and text. They mention a multimodal NER network that uses both image and text. Also, the results section compares models with and without visual contexts, showing improvements when images are included. The conclusion states that they combined visual and textual information to outperform text-only", "answers": ["Yes", "Yes"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3784}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking whether they evaluate only on English datasets. I need to check the article to find out.\n\nLooking through the article, the experiments section mentions the Penn Treebank, which is a standard dataset for NLP tasks, and it's known to be an English corpus. Also, in the sensitivity analysis, they mention WSJ (Wall Street Journal), which is part of the Penn Treebank and also English. The related work section references BIBREF13, which I assume is the Penn Treebank. \n\nHowever, the article doesn't explicitly state that they only use English datasets.", "answers": ["Yes", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4320}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the highest MRR score achieved by their system. I need to look through the article to find any mention of MRR scores.\n\nLooking at the introduction section, it says, \"our system achieved highest ‘MRR’ score for Factoid Question Answering task.\" Then later, in the Related Work section under BioASQ, it mentions that the highest MRR in the 6th edition was 0.4325. But the article states that their system achieved a MRR of 0.6103 in one of the test batches. \n\n", "answers": ["0.5115", "0.6103"], "all_classes": null, "length": 6810}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what datasets the authors evaluated their approach on. I need to look through the article to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll scan the sections where experiments are discussed. In the \"Experiments\" section, the article mentions evaluating on two tasks: part-of-speech (POS) induction and unsupervised dependency parsing. It specifically says they use the Penn Treebank (BIBREF13) for these tasks. \n\nLooking further, in the \"Learning & Inference\" section, there's a mention of training the parser until the data likelihood converges and reporting results on", "answers": [" Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4327}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how the authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models, and optimization techniques.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the article. The article talks about NeuronBlocks, a DNN toolkit for NLP. In the \"Related Work\" section, they mention existing frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. They say these frameworks offer flexibility but require a large overhead of mastering framework details. Then they mention higher-level abstractions are favored by engineers.\n\nWait, the question is about evidence for the claim that choosing from multiple", "answers": ["By conducting a survey among engineers", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1692}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking on which benchmarks the authors achieved the state of the art. I need to look through the article to find the relevant information.\n\nLooking at the \"KBQA End-Task Results\" section, there's a mention of Table 3 comparing their system with baselines. The article states that their method improves the KBQA end task by 2-3% compared to the baseline relation detector. Then, in the conclusion, it says their KBQA system achieves state-of-the-arts. \n\nSpecifically, the last row of Table 3 mentions achieving a new state-of-the-art", "answers": ["SimpleQuestions, WebQSP", "WebQSP, SimpleQuestions"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4524}
