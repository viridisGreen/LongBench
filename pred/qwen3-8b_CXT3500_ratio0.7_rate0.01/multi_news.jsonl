That seems straightforward, but maybe it's not as important as the other passages. The user might want a summary that includes all, but perhaps the main focus is on the Kalashnikov story. Still, I should mention it briefly.\n\nPassage 2 is about Mikhail Kalashnikov, the inventor of the AK-47. He wrote a letter to the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch Kirill before his death, expressing guilt over the deaths caused by his invention. He had previously refused to accept responsibility, blaming other countries' policies. The letter's authenticity is in question, with his daughter suggesting a priest helped write it. The letter raises questions about moral responsibility and the impact of his invention, which has been widely used, including by criminals and child soldiers. His funeral was attended by Putin, and the Church's response is mentioned, supporting the weapon for national defense.\n\nPassage 3 repeats some information from Passage 2, like the letter to the Patriarch, the context of the AK-47's design during WWII, its global proliferation, and the Church's stance. It also mentions his daughter's comments and the Church's role post-Soviet era. There's a note about his atheism during the Soviet times and his later religious conversion.\n\nSo, the main subject is Kalashnikov's guilt over the AK-47's use.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

But it turns out that something can make them even nastier: cigarette smoke. Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

The police found him beaten and stabbed outside his home, and his Porsche was missing. Homicide detectives are investigating, and there are neighborhood cameras that might help. His wife and daughters found the body, and a neighbor mentioned hearing screams. The Geyer family's security cameras were checked, and the company Wella expressed sadness.\n\nPassage 2 is from MODERN SALON, announcing his death on January 23, 2017. It mentions arrests have been made, his role at Wella, his mentorship, and some quotes he was known for. The company and colleagues are devastated, and there's a call for sharing memories.\n\nPassage 3 adds that police think two men broke in and stole his Porsche. He was VP of Education at Wella, called \"big daddy,\" and his family and friends are shocked. Eden Sassoon, daughter of Vidal Sassoon, comments on his impact. He wanted to be remembered for relationships and making people feel good.\n\nPassage 4 is similar to Passage 1, confirming the death, missing Porsche, and his role at Coty Inc. It mentions his Facebook post about his career and his positive attitude. The AP report also notes the lack of motive.\n\nNow, I need to combine all these into a concise summary. I should mention the date of death (Jan 23, 2017, but some sources say Jan 24, which might be the day of discovery), his profession, the circumstances of death (stabbed, missing car), police investigation, neighborhood security cameras, his role at Wella/Coty, his mentorship, quotes, and reactions from colleagues and family.

{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the three news passages provided. Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about a study by Young-Ho Eom from the University of Toulouse analyzing Wikipedia articles to determine the most important people. The initial analysis using Google's PageRank algorithm placed Frank Sinatra first, Michael Jackson second, and Pope Pius XII third. However, when considering all 24 language editions, the results changed, with Adolf Hitler coming first, Michael Jackson second, and Madonna third. The study aimed to check if Wikipedia's attention is biased towards certain groups, like Western males. The researchers used PageRank, which measures importance based on incoming links, but found that Carl Linnaeus was the top due to his extensive naming of species. They then used CheiRank (outgoing links) and combined both into 2DRank, leading to Frank Sinatra's top position in some editions.\n\nPassage 2 is about the Internet Archive's efforts to archive web pages to prevent broken links. They crawl sites to save pages and their references, so when original pages change or are removed, archived versions are preserved. The goal is to fix broken links and maintain the integrity of web references.\n\nPassage 3 is a follow-up to the study mentioned in Passage 1. It discusses the same research team trying to find the most influential thinker. Using Wikipedia's links, they found Carl Linnaeus as the most influential, beating out figures like Hitler, Jesus, and Newton. The reason is that Linnaeus' system of taxonomy is referenced in countless scientific pages across all languages. This study contrasts with a previous one where Karl Marx was considered the most influential based on academic citations.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. The key points are the study by Eom, the different methods (PageRank, CheiRank, 2DRank), the varying results depending on the language editions, the bias towards Western males, and the mention of Linnaeus due to his taxonomy system. Also, the Internet Archive's role in preserving web content. I should mention both studies (the first and third) as they are related. I need to ensure the summary is one page, so I'll need to be concise, avoid redundancy, and structure the information logically. Let me check for any overlapping information and make sure each passage's unique points are covered. Also, note that Passage 2 is about a different topic (Internet Archive", "answers": ["Using methods borrowed from Google, a group of researchers has analyzed all Wikipedia pages and determined that, at least on the English language version of the site, Frank Sinatra is the world's most important person. Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions. Last year, in a separate study analyzing academic references, one team deemed Karl Marx to be the world's most important scholar, according to the Smithsonian.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 is a quote from someone wishing the best of luck to a person (maybe a TV host) and hoping they work for all American people as they did for their ratings. It seems like a critique of the previous host's focus on ratings over public service. Maybe it's a comment on Trump's hosting of The Apprentice, since he's mentioned in Passage 2.\n\nPassage 2 is a quote from Lincoln's inaugural address, shared by Trump. The person is saying that this quote inspired them during their time as governor and hopes it inspires the current host. This might be a reference to Trump's own political career, linking his leadership style to Lincoln's.\n\nPassage 3 mentions Arnold Schwarzenegger's ratings being \"swamped\" by Trump's. It's a comparison, suggesting that Schwarzenegger's hosting debut didn't match Trump's success in terms of ratings. This seems to be a critique of Schwarzenegger's performance as a new host.\n\nPassage 4 is a detailed report about the return of NBC's Celebrity Apprentice with Schwarzenegger as host. It states that the premiere didn't beat ABC and CBS in ratings. The show had 4.9 million viewers, while The Bachelor had 6.6 million and CBS had over 6 million. The ratings dropped by 22% compared to Trump's previous season (2014-2015), which averaged 7.6 million. There's also mention of Trump's continued involvement as an executive producer, which was controversial. The network promoted the new host and season, but early reviews were not positive. However, NBC's ratings guru noted that last year's premiere had less competition and that The Wall had a strong lead-in.\n\nNow, I need to connect these passages. The main theme is the transition of hosting for The Apprentice from Trump to Schwarzenegger and the resulting ratings drop. Passage 1 and 2 are likely comments from someone (maybe a political figure or critic) about Trump's focus on ratings and the inspiration from Lincoln. Passage 3 is a direct comparison of Schwarzenegger's performance versus Trump's. Passage 4 provides the detailed data and context of the ratings and the network's response.\n\nI should structure the summary to first mention the transition of hosting, the ratings comparison, the controversy around Trump", "answers": ["Arnold Schwarzenegger seems to think Donald Trump needs a lesson in making friends after the president-elect chose to criticize his Celebrity Apprentice successor. \"Wow, the ratings are in and [new host] Arnold Schwarzenegger got 'swamped' (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT,\" Trump tweeted Friday after the Trump-less show premiered Monday to 4.9 million viewers, according to Nielsen. The last season hosted by Trump averaged 7.6 million viewers, per Fortune. \"So much for … being a movie star,\" Trump continued. \"But who cares, he supported [John] Kasich & Hillary [Clinton].\" Schwarzenegger offered up a reply on Twitter, tweeting, \"I wish you the best of luck and I hope you'll work for ALL of the American people as aggressively as you worked for your ratings.\" He next shared a video he made after the election in which he quotes Abraham Lincoln's inaugural speech, beginning, \"We are not enemies, but friends.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 is about Samsung's new privacy policy for their smart TVs. The key points are that the policy allows Samsung and partners to listen to users' conversations via voice recognition, which has caused public backlash comparing it to Orwell's 1984. The policy mentions that data is transmitted to third parties, and users can disable the feature, but Samsung still collects usage data. They mention encryption and the microphone indicator on screen. The concern is about the Internet of Things and data collection.\n\nPassage 2 is more detailed about Samsung's SmartTV features, including recommendations, device info, voice recognition, gesture controls, facial recognition, fitness services, kids' content, and third-party data sharing. It explains how they collect data for recommendations, the process of voice recognition involving third-party services like Nuance, and options to disable features. It also covers facial recognition storing images locally and third-party data collection.\n\nPassage 3 discusses Microsoft's Xbox One and the new Kinect sensor that's always listening, even when the console is off. The feature allows voice commands to turn it on, which users find creepy, comparing it to 1984. Microsoft claims it's for quick response and mentions the Kinect can read heartbeats and recognize voices. There's a mention of past privacy concerns with Kinect and Microsoft's response about privacy protections.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. The main themes are privacy concerns with smart devices from Samsung and Microsoft, data collection practices, comparisons to 1984, user reactions, and company responses.

However, after his nomination to Trump's Cabinet, his financial disclosures showed less than $700 million. Ross argued that family trusts, which he didn't have to disclose, accounted for over $2 billion. Forbes decided to remove him from the Forbes 400 list, and Ross admitted the transfer of assets happened between the election and his nomination. Forbes concluded that the $2 billion never existed, suggesting Ross lied. The article also mentions his history of misleading investors, leading to fines and lawsuits, and his failure to disclose 19 suits during confirmation. His team denied the allegations, but the controversy is compounded by his stake in a shipping company linked to Putin.\n\nPassage 2 discusses Trump's defense of appointing wealthy individuals like Ross to his administration. Trump argues that he doesn't want poor people in key economic roles, stating that Ross and Gary Cohn had to give up their wealth for these positions. Trump claims he wants people who can drive economic growth, even if they're rich.

The discovery came when Ross, 79, contacted Forbes in October to refute his ranking: Last year he was listed with a net worth of $2.9 billion on the Forbes 400; he claimed he was worth closer to $3.7 billion. Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague. When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about—in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"—and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

She used the metaphor of cancer stages to show that all forms of sexual misconduct are serious.

Then it mentions North Korea's chemical weapons capability, up to 4,500 metric tons annually, with a large arsenal including mustard, phosgene, and sarin. There's a mention of Kim Jong-nam's death in Malaysia, with North Korea denying responsibility and blaming Malaysia. The North Korean government claims Malaysia is responsible, and they're a nuclear state. The case has mysteries, like not acknowledging Kim's identity and refusing to let Malaysia question embassy staff. The two women accused are being held, but their families say they were forced.\n\nPassage 2 confirms Kim Jong-nam was killed by VX, a banned nerve agent. Malaysia's police chief detected VX on his face and eyes. North Korea denies involvement, accuses Malaysia of having sinister motives. The toxicology report shows the woman who interacted with Kim got sick. VX is extremely potent, can kill in minutes, and is hard to detect. Experts suggest a small amount was used, maybe on cloths. The airport is being decontaminated, but VX is persistent. Kim was a critic of North Korea, exiled, and not considered a future leader. North Korea hasn't confirmed his identity. There's a diplomatic crisis, with Malaysia expelling North Korean envoy. North Korea is not a signatory to the CWC and has a large chemical stockpile.\n\nPassage 3 reiterates the VX use in the assassination, confirming Kim's identity as Kim Jong-nam. The police chief says VX was detected, and one woman got sick. The airport hasn't been decontaminated yet. The case is a diplomatic crisis, with North Korea accusing Malaysia of bias. Toxicologists are puzzled about the women not being affected. VX is very toxic, with an antidote. North Korea's chemical capabilities are significant, with potential for 4,500-12,000 tons. They have mustard, phosgene, sarin, and VX. There's concern about using them in artillery. North Korea is linked to sharing chemical tech with Syria and Iran.

He said that one of two women believed to have rubbed the extremely toxic substance on Kim's face with their hands suffered from vomiting after the attack. The New York Times reports that VX agent can be created by mixing two compounds—and police suspect the two women put the substances on Kim's face, one after the other, to create a deadly dose. The police chief said the airport where Kim was attacked is now being decontaminated.

The FBI and DOJ opposed its release, but the President approved it, citing public interest. The memo details findings about the FISA process during the 2016 election, including issues with the application for surveillance on Page. It mentions that the application didn't disclose the role of the DNC and Clinton campaign in funding Steele, who provided information for the dossier. There's also mention of Steele's unauthorized media contacts and his termination as an FBI source. The memo also points out that the FBI used the Steele dossier to justify surveillance, even though it was unverified.

The director is Joe Johnston, and the cast includes Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Emily Blunt, etc. The review points out that the movie tries to blend old gothic style with modern horror elements, but it doesn't work well. The makeup by Rick Baker is criticized as campy, and the effects look dated. The story is set in the 1890s in England, with Lawrence Talbot being cursed. Del Toro's performance is compared to Lon Chaney Jr., but it's seen as lacking emotional connection. The film is considered unnecessary and a mediocrity, not as bad as Van Helsing but still a misfire.\n\nPassage 2 is another review. It starts with a vivid description of the opening scene, then says the film is visually beautiful but disappointing. The director is Joe Johnston, and the casting of Del Toro is criticized as a bad choice. The film is compared to British crime series, but the review mentions it's more about Hollywood mythology than ethnic fables. The review also mentions the DVD focus on the original 1941 film and other werewolf movies like An American Werewolf in London.

The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the key points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about BP's CEO, Bob Dudley, getting a 20% pay increase to $19.6 million in 2015 despite the company's $5.2 billion loss. The author argues that this is justified because managing the company in low oil prices is harder than when prices were high. Dudley's achievements include cleaning up from the 2010 Gulf spill and improving safety and culture. His pay is compared to Shell's CEO, who had a significant drop in pay, but Dudley's increase is due to pension and deferred bonuses.\n\nPassage 2 mentions a shareholder advisory group, Glass Lewis, criticizing the bonuses, especially since BP had a poor performance. They recommended shareholders vote against the pay. Dudley's cash bonus increased, and the CFO also got his max bonus. The company's loss and job cuts are highlighted. BP's defense is that they managed well in a tough environment, and the pay was approved by 86% of investors last year.\n\nPassage 3 details the shareholder protest where 59% voted against Dudley's pay, the first time for a top British company. This is part of a growing trend of investors opposing executive pay. Other companies like Smith & Nephew also faced rejections. The median pay for energy CEOs dropped, but Dudley's was higher than some peers. Institutional investors criticized the board's discretion, and BP's board acknowledged the concerns and plans to address them.\n\nPassage 5 summarizes the shareholder vote against the pay policy, with 59% rejecting it. BP might reduce dividends due to low oil prices. The chairman defended the pay as based on performance, but the board won't change Dudley's pay despite the vote. The vote was nonbinding, and the next binding vote is in 2017.\n\nNow, I need to combine all these points into a concise summary. Start with the main event: BP's CEO pay increase and shareholder backlash. Mention the financial context (loss, job cuts, oil prices). Include the arguments for and against the pay (Dudley's achievements vs. shareholder criticism). Compare with other executives. Note the nonbinding vote and future implications.

The company had indicated earlier in the day that it may also have to reduce its dividend, the Wall Street Journal reports. Dudley is set to receive the full bonus he was eligible for, which comes to $4.2 million (including $1.4 million in cash and a portion in deferred BP shares), per an earlier MarketWatch report.

It talks about Eusebio Felix, a top investigator in Peru, being put on leave for misleading the public. He claimed to have caught a gang of serial killers called Pishtacos, who are based on an ancient Andean legend. The legend involves extracting fat from victims. The police initially said up to 60 people were murdered and their fat sold to Italian cosmetics makers for thousands per liter. However, the investigation was later found to be botched, with only one victim confirmed. The police held a press conference showing a bottle of Inca Kola with what they claimed was human fat and body parts from a grave. The police chief, General Miguel Hidalgo, expressed embarrassment, and local police in Huanuco disputed the claims, stating there was only one murder linked to the cocaine trade. The suspects are still in custody, possibly bottling fat to intimidate rivals. Critics include anthropologists, politicians, and doctors, who pointed out the misuse of the myth, the lack of evidence, and the impracticality of selling fat. \n\nPassage 2 is from BBC News, written by Dan Collyns.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about Cheryl Strayed's memoir \"Wild\" and how it's been used as a metaphor for overcoming personal struggles through hiking the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). The author criticizes the idea that just hiking a trail will solve life's problems, especially for those who are unprepared. There's a concern about overcrowding on the trail and the negative impact of inexperienced hikers on the environment and other hikers. The Latin phrase \"solvitur ambulando\" is mentioned, which means \"it is solved by walking,\" highlighting the cathartic effect of hiking. However, the passage warns against a mindset of deliberate helplessness.\n\nPassage 2 discusses the increase in PCT hikers due to the movie adaptation of \"Wild.\" The Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA) reports a significant rise in website traffic and permit requests. It provides details about the trail's length, the number of people who have completed it, and the demographics, noting more women are now hiking. It also mentions the financial and physical challenges of a through-hike, including costs and the need for proper gear. The PCTA is promoting responsible hiking practices with the #responsiblywild campaign and mentions an upcoming movie about the Appalachian Trail.\n\nPassage 3 addresses the overcrowding issue on the PCT, especially since the release of \"Wild.\" It cites statistics showing a spike in permit numbers, with the PCTA implementing a permit system to manage hiker numbers. Environmental concerns are raised, such as damage to fragile desert ecosystems and increased costs for services. There's a discussion about the balance between preserving the trail and maintaining its accessibility. The passage also includes personal anecdotes and quotes from hikers and officials, highlighting the community's efforts to manage the trail without restricting access too much.\n\nNow, I need to combine these points into a concise summary.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

Let me start by reading through both passages carefully to gather all the key points.\n\nFirst, Passage 1 mentions that she died at 66 in Edinburgh after being hospitalized. She was part of the BBC show \"Two Fat Ladies\" with Jennifer Paterson. She was a cook, food historian, and champion of hunting and shooting. She had a fiery temper, was non-PC, and had a controversial past, like being convicted for attending an illegal hare coursing event. She also supported eating badgers from culls. Her background includes a privileged upbringing with a violent alcoholic father, becoming a barrister, then quitting law due to alcoholism and starting cooking. She ran a bookshop, had a show with Paterson, and later did other TV shows. She was a countryside campaigner and had a strong personality.\n\nPassage 2 also states her death at 66 in Edinburgh, ill for months. She became a lawyer, then turned to cooking in her 40s. The show \"Two Fat Ladies\" was known for its irreverent style and indulgent recipes. They used lard, bacon, and joked about vegetarians. The show led to a book, but critics said recipes were hard to follow. Paterson died in 1999 from cancer. She had a complex personality, hated carrots, had a past with alcohol, and wrote about her recovery. She was a guild butcher, worked in various culinary roles, and was a countryside advocate. She criticized the BBC for dropping her show due to her views on hunting. She was a Rector at the University of Aberdeen and had a Catholic upbringing. She was declared bankrupt due to spending her inheritance.\n\nNow, I need to combine these points into a concise summary. Start with her death, her fame with Two Fat Ladies, her personality and controversies, her background, career shifts, other TV work, advocacy, and personal life. Make sure to mention her legacy and the tributes from colleagues. Avoid repeating information and keep it within one page.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2870}

They decided not to go to the summit as dusk approached. They used the app to navigate the west face, which is known for loose rocks and steep terrain. Jane went ahead to check the route, and her husband asked if it was safe. He heard an exclamation and a rock fall, realized she had fallen, and climbed to safety to call for help. The rescue team found her body 150 meters down. The coroner concluded it was an accidental death. Detective Constable Tim Bird mentioned that her light boots weren't suitable for the terrain and that the app's detail wasn't as good as a proper map. They tried a different route, which wasn't ideal.\n\nPassage 2 seems similar but adds more context. Chris Lloyd from the rescue team described the route as tricky, especially at the top. Tryfan accounts for 30% of their incidents. Andy Simpson from Mountain Rescue England and Wales advises using maps and compasses alongside electronic devices. Detective Bird again mentions the Ordnance Survey app's lack of detail and the risk of the route they took. The coroner's conclusion is the same.\n\nPassage 3 is a concise version of the same event. Jane and Gary decided against the summit, used the app, Jane fell 30 feet down a cliff. The coroner's conclusion is accidental death. The husband raised the alarm, rescue team found her body. The same points about the route and the app are mentioned.\n\nNow, I need to combine all these into a coherent summary. I should start with the main event: Jane Wilson's death while hiking Tryfan. Mention her and her husband's decision to avoid the summit, using the smartphone app. Describe the incident: Jane going ahead, the fall, husband's response, rescue team's role. Include the coroner's conclusion. Then add the expert opinions from the rescue team members and the advice about using maps and compasses with electronic devices.

The Manchester Evening News reports Gary heard his wife fall, got to safety, and called for help. Rescuers found the 53-year-old librarian's body at the bottom of a 30-foot cliff with a fractured skull.

A detective says the app map \"would have been small and not as detailed\" and took the couple on a route that was not the safest.

He praised Obama as a credible candidate and supported Perry and Romney despite their issues. He criticized their opponents for anti-science positions but praised Perry's HPV vaccine policy and Romney's Massachusetts healthcare plan. Also, he mentioned not endorsing anyone and gave a nod to Chris Christie. He also mocked Obama's use of Warren Buffett as a tax example.\n\nPassage 2: Indiana's Mitch Daniels says Republicans should be forgiving of Perry's debate performances, thinking it's too early to judge.

He criticized Debbie Wasserman Schultz's talking points after a GOP win in a Democratic district.\n\nPassage 4: Sen. Mark Warner called the government shutdown crisis embarrassing, blaming tea party Republicans. Sen. Lamar Alexander blamed Harry Reid for creating a crisis over disaster aid, saying the Senate should have approved the House bill.\n\nPassage 5: Sen. Lindsey Graham says the US should consider all options, including military action, against Pakistan due to intelligence ties with terrorists. He didn't directly confirm military action but emphasized hostile acts.\n\nPassage 6: Obama's adviser David Plouffe says no major changes in White House staff or Cabinet for 2012. He pushes for the American Jobs Act and mentions possible aid cuts to Pakistan if they don't stop Haqqani network support.\n\nNow, I need to condense all these into a concise summary. Start with the 2012 election context.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about Seattle's new soda tax of 1.75 cents per ounce, introduced in 2018. The mayor, Ed Murray, supported it for reducing sugar consumption, funding community college, and helping low-income families. However, the passage criticizes the tax, pointing out that it doesn't actually make people healthier, doesn't raise revenue as intended, and causes regressive effects. It mentions Cook County, Illinois, repealing their tax due to public backlash, and examples like Philadelphia and Seattle's own issues with people shopping outside the city. Also, the tax doesn't apply to milk-based drinks, and Starbucks rejected it.\n\nPassage 2 focuses on the impact on Costco. A case of Gatorade increased by over 60%, and Costco put up signs directing customers to suburban stores. The tax affects sugary drinks but not those with milk as the primary ingredient. There's a discussion about the tax being regressive and inconsistent, with some residents upset and others questioning the tax's effectiveness.\n\nPassage 3 details Cook County's repeal of their soda tax, which cost businesses like Daniel Stein's vending company $75k. The repeal was due to public outcry and loss of sales, with big companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo opposing it. Retailers and restaurants also suffered, with Costco seeing a 34% drop in sales and a 38% increase in suburban stores. The tax's impact was significant, causing displacement of shoppers and financial strain.\n\nPassage 4 mentions a bill to bring the soda tax statewide in Washington, re-introduced in Spokane. The tax would add nearly two cents per ounce, affecting syrups and powders. Local businesses are concerned about increased costs, but some support it for health reasons. Seattle expects $15 million from the tax to fund healthy meals for low-income families.\n\nPassage 5 is more critical, arguing the tax didn't achieve its goals. Prices doubled, leading to public backlash, with people shopping outside the city. Costco's response is highlighted, and there's a critique of the tax's inconsistency and lack of behavioral change. The author compares it to the \"frog in a boiling pot\" theory, suggesting gradual increases are better. The tax's failure to raise revenue and improve health is noted, with negative impacts on local businesses.\n\nNow, I", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Her mother reported her missing because she was supposed to work on a marijuana farm. She was found on \"The Bachelor\" reality show, which led the authorities to remove her from the missing persons list. There's mention of a Facebook post where someone identified her, and she made some humorous tweets about her driver's license photo.\n\nPassage 2 is a retweet from SFGate referencing her tweet about the worst drivers license photo.

The sheriff's office said they tried contacting her but couldn't, so she remained on the list. However, later, the mother had contact on November 12, and the sheriff's office removed her from the list after she was found on the show.\n\nPassage 4 is more detailed about the \"Humboldt 35\" missing persons. It contrasts them with the \"Humboldt Five\" from a 2016 Crime Watch Daily story. The article discusses the high per-capita rate of missing persons in Humboldt, some cases being cold cases, and the challenges in removing names from the database. It also includes a case of Jeff Joseph, a dispensary owner who disappeared in 2014, possibly linked to the cannabis industry.

The judge reduced his bond from $1 million to zero, enabling him to return home. Defense attorneys argued that ballistic evidence cast doubt on the prosecution’s claim that Merritt was responsible for four drive-by shootings that hit 11 vehicles on Phoenix-area freeways in August and September 2015.

The judge overseeing the case of Leslie Merritt Jr. reduced his bond to zero and said he can return to his home under electronic monitoring, the AP reports. He was expected to be released later in the day. The reduction of the bond—once $1 million—was a major victory as defense lawyers contend that ballistic tests cast doubt on the claim by authorities that Merritt was behind four of the freeway shootings. \"With all due respect your honor, there's no evidence against him to show he's responsible for this,\" defense lawyer Jason Lamm said. \"He is no more the I-10 shooter than, respectfully, you are.\" Merritt lifted up his shackled arms in celebration as he walked from the courtroom. After the hearing, family members hugged and shook the hands of defense lawyers. Merritt has pleaded not guilty to drive-by shooting, aggravated assault, and other charges. The shootings caused panic on Phoenix-area freeways, where 11 vehicles were hit in August and September. Detectives took Merritt into custody on Sept. 18; in court the next day, Merritt adamantly denied shooting any cars, telling the judge, \"I'm the wrong guy.\" His lawyers immediately began raising questions about the evidence, citing ballistics information and phone records they say provided an alibi for their client.

The sheriff mentions she was a disgruntled employee and a former security guard. The gun was a 9mm Glock, legally purchased. The motive is unknown. There were six victims, but details are withheld for the families. The response was quick, with no shots fired by law enforcement. Hospitals received four with serious injuries, two stable, two seriously injured. The area is near residential areas and has warehouses. It's the third shooting in the US in two days, following incidents in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nPassage 2 repeats some of the same information but adds more context. It mentions the shooting was the third in 24 hours and the third in Harford County in a year. The victims were both inside and outside the facility. The shooter used multiple magazines. Rite Aid closed the center, and Clorox halted operations. There's a family reunification center, and the response involved multiple agencies. Witnesses describe the chaos, with emergency vehicles and a lockdown at a nearby school. The area has other businesses like Clorox, Zenith, and Maines Paper.

The study used data from 64,000 Danish children and their mothers. They found that women who took acetaminophen more frequently had a higher risk of their children being diagnosed with ADHD or hyperkinetic syndrome. However, the study doesn't prove causation, just an association. Experts like Dr. Ritz advise avoiding chronic use until more research is done. They also mention that infections during pregnancy can affect brain development, so it's possible that the infection, not the drug, could be the cause. The FDA has limited doses due to liver risks, and Tylenol's manufacturer says there's no proven causal link.\n\nPassage 2 is similar but adds more details. It mentions the same study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, analyzing data from the Danish National Birth Cohort. The study found that longer use, especially later in pregnancy, is linked to higher risks. They note that ADHD-like behaviors aren't the same as a diagnosis. The editorial emphasizes the study shows an association, not causation. Dr. Ritz mentions that more than half the mothers used acetaminophen, but dosage wasn't considered.

The film is criticized for focusing too much on the creepy aspects, like the killer's role and the detailed murder scenes, which might have upset the story's balance. Saoirse Ronan's performance is praised as the only strong element. The director's past work with splatter films is noted, which might have influenced the film's tone. The film's visual effects, especially the afterlife scenes, are highlighted as beautiful but not effective overall.\n\nPassage 2 gives a brief synopsis of the movie. It describes Susie Salmon's perspective from the afterlife, her father's hobby of building ships, and the killer's dollhouse and underground lair. The film is described as straddling multiple worlds and using models as a visual motif. It praises Tucci's performance as the killer and Ronan's portrayal of Susie. The director's ability to animate the afterlife is mentioned, and the film's mix of moments is noted, with some being poignant.\n\nPassage 3 is more critical. It states that the film diverges from the book's tone and complexity, simplifying the story into a fairy tale. The afterlife scenes are seen as too whimsical, and the sexual content from the book is omitted. The killer is portrayed as a creepy neighbor, and while Tucci's performance is good, the film's focus on the killer and father's grief is criticized for lacking depth. The review gives a C+ rating, suggesting it's safe but not deep.\n\nPassage 4 mentions the movie's release, cast, and director. It notes the challenge of adapting the book due to the dead narrator's perspective. The film has clashing tones and struggles with depicting the afterlife. Ronan's performance is praised, and Tucci's role as the killer is highlighted. The film is compared to Jackson's previous works, but the afterlife scenes are seen as cheesy.

Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged.

Initially met with skepticism, Parker’s theory about the high-speed stream of charged particles (plasma) flowing from the sun into space was later confirmed by satellite observations, revolutionizing solar science. The renaming marks the first time NASA has named a spacecraft after a living scientist, a historic milestone celebrating Parker’s groundbreaking work.  \n\nThe", "answers": ["NASA is going to the sun. More specifically, it's launching an unmanned probe next year that will travel closer to the star than any spacecraft has done previously. \"It's a spacecraft loaded with technological breakthroughs that will solve many of the largest mysteries about our star,\" says Nicola Fox of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com. Two puzzles: Scientists hope to better understand two things in particular: \"How is the solar wind accelerated, and why is the ... corona so much hotter than the solar surface?\" (It's 3 million degrees Fahrenheit vs. 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit.) Why it matters: Generally, solar storms are relatively harmless when they reach Earth, but these particle bursts occasionally wreak havoc on satellites and here on Earth, and they have the potential to be devastating. \"The more we know about how these processes work, the better we can get at predicting when they will happen,\" writes Loren Grush at the Verge."], "all_classes": null, "length": 10147}

The hackers penetrated their network as early as July, and it wasn't fully contained until Sunday. The company only disclosed the breach late last week, after being prodded by a journalist, Brian Krebs. They didn't mention when the attack started or how many customers were affected, but they said SSNs and birth dates weren't compromised. They faced criticism for not informing customers sooner, unlike Target, which acted quickly. Also, state attorneys general are investigating both breaches, possibly linking them to Eastern European criminal groups.\n\nPassage 2 talks about a report from iSight, a computer firm, on the Target breach. The report details the malware used, which was placed in POS systems. The malware used memory scraping to capture unencrypted card data during the authorization stage. The report mentions regions like Eastern Europe and Brazil with the skills to create such malware. It notes that this method is new and effective, leading to more potential breaches. The report doesn't name the culprits, as the US government is still investigating.\n\nPassage 3 mentions that the Target breach was part of a larger international hacking campaign against multiple retailers. The report from federal and private investigators was sent to financial services and retailers, giving details about the attack's source. It's part of a broader, sophisticated campaign.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. Start with the main events: both Target and Neiman Marcus had breaches. Target's breach was larger, affecting 40 million credit/debit cards and 70 million with other info. Neiman's breach started in July, not contained until late December, and they disclosed it later.

Also, there's a similar situation in South Africa with a lion named Sylvester escaping, and officials are considering relocation instead of killing. The broader context includes the decline in lion populations due to hunting, habitat loss, and human-wildlife conflict.\n\nPassage 2 focuses more on the death of Mohawk, highlighting the public outrage. It describes the lion being tormented by a crowd for hours before attacking a boda boda rider. The rangers didn't use tranquilizers, leading to criticism. There's info about Mohawk's background, his popularity, and the park's unfenced southern area.

Mohawk became upset by the noise and the growing crowd—Kenya Wildlife Service officials tell the AP about 400 had surrounded him—and lunged at a 27-year-old man, who was sent to the hospital with bruises and severe lacerations on his back. The wildlife service already had an animal management team on the scene, but those rangers had only rifles, not tranquilizers. After Mohawk pounced on the bystander, the rangers felt they couldn't wait for a second team on its way with tranqs—so they unleashed what the Star says was nine bullets, leaving the animal \"roaring and writhing in pain\" as he died. \"If the rangers had the right equipment, this lion would not have died,\" a local resident tells the paper. \"You can't keep a lion in the midst of people for so many hours without stressing it. We blame them for this heinous act.\" The shooting has prompted plenty of backlash on social media, including a #JusticeForMohawk hashtag, but the wildlife service says it had no choice once the lion started attacking humans. \"This action was taken as a last resort after an escalation of the situation and a concern for public safety,\" the Kenya Wildlife Service says, per CNN.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet. But as they did their own research, they soon came to their own conclusion in what Brown calls a \"jaw-dropping moment\" that Planet Nine could be the real deal. Now they're simply hoping more astronomers join in to actually try to spot the alleged planet—and they're not concerned it will face Pluto's fate. \"That's not even a question—it's definitely a planet,\" Brown says.

And now researchers are finding that among those with coronary heart disease (CHD)—which the Mayo Clinic reports develops from damaged or diseased blood vessels typically caused by blockage and inflammation—yo-yo dieting may dramatically increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, and death. Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

This seems like a controversial moment where he might have been trying to show inclusivity but in a way that was seen as dismissive or condescending.\n\n3. Trump criticized CNN for being \"angry and hateful\" and said he doesn't watch it anymore. He also mentioned wanting the network to be \"straight\" and more interesting. This shows his ongoing feud with the media.\n\n4. He refused to discuss potential military retaliation against Russia, comparing it to not talking about military plans.

The key points here are the new location feature, user control, and privacy options.\n\nPassage 2 is more detailed. It talks about Twitter's response to bullying of Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda, after his death. Trolls sent her messages blaming her for his suicide and altered images. Zelda left Twitter and asked for account removals, which Twitter did. The company promised policy updates, including self-harm and private info policies. Then it shifts to other harassment issues, like Imani Gandy's experience with racial, gender, and medical discrimination. She faced threats and Twitter's policies didn't cover rape threats. The article mentions Twitter's reporting tools but points out their limitations, like attackers creating new accounts. There's a mention of a third-party tool, Block Together, and criticism from activists like Soraya Chemaly about Twitter's free speech stance affecting their response. The conclusion is that harassment is a widespread issue, and Twitter needs better protections.\n\nPassage 3 is about Alexa Internet donating crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, which is added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period.

Two more details that allegedly came from the South's National Intelligence Service briefing: word that additional tunnels have been dug out at the North's nuclear test site that would facilitate future detonations, and suspicions that the next ICBM test firing might be directed toward the North Pacific but aimed at a lower angle, which would in theory allow it to fly further than previous tests, which had more of an upward trajectory.

Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of all the news passages provided. Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the key points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about a discovery in southern Australia, specifically a rock shelter in the Flinders Ranges, which dates back 49,000 years. The discovery was made by archaeologist Giles Hamm and an Aboriginal elder, Clifford Coulthard. They found a site with evidence of human activity, like a blackened roof from fires, and artifacts such as tools and bone fragments from a large marsupial called Diprotodon. This suggests that humans might have arrived in Australia earlier than the previously accepted 50,000 years ago. The presence of juvenile Diprotodon bones indicates hunting by humans. Also, there's a mention of Aboriginal Australians being the oldest continuous civilization, and the debate about the timing of their arrival.\n\nPassage 2 details the excavation methods used at Warratyi rock shelter. They used a grid system, sieves, and careful documentation. They found 4,300 objects and 200 bone fragments. The site's age was determined to be 49,000 years. Professor Prideaux notes that this site has megafauna remains and human artifacts together, which challenges the climate change theory for megafauna extinction. The study was published in Nature and challenges Eurocentric views about Indigenous Australian technology.\n\nPassage 4 (since the user listed Passage 4, but the content seems similar to Passage 1 and 2) mentions the Warratyi site again, confirming the 49,000-year date. It highlights the discovery of bone and quartz tools, ochre use, and the local innovation of technologies. It contrasts with the Carpenter's Gap site and discusses the debate over dating methods. The site's location in the arid interior shows early human expansion. The megafauna interaction is noted, and the study's significance in challenging previous assumptions about Indigenous Australians.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. Start with the main discovery: the Warratyi rock shelter in Flinders Ranges, 49,000 years old. Mention the accidental discovery by Hamm and Coulthard.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens?

Santorum, appearing groggy and dressed in a suit and tie (without a sweater vest), dismissed his underperformance, attributing it to Romney’s alleged reliance on “trucking in” supporters by purchasing tickets to ensure turnout. He emphasized that his campaign did not engage in such tactics, calling it unethical. Romney’s campaign swiftly rejected Santorum’s claims, with spokeswoman Andrea Saul accusing him of making “statements not grounded in the truth", "answers": ["Fresh off his loss to Mitt Romney at CPAC, Rick Santorum hit the talk shows this morning, and he's downplaying the victory, reports Politico: \"You have to talk to the Romney campaign and how many tickets they bought—we've heard all sorts of things,\" Santorum told CNN. \"Ron Paul has won those (straw polls) because he trucks in a lot of people, pays for their ticket, and they come in and vote.

It mentions that the EPA and Magnolia Homes (which is Magnolia Waco Properties, LLC) reached a settlement over alleged violations of the TSCA RRP Rule related to lead paint during renovations shown on Fixer Upper. The violations involved not following lead-safe work practices, and the settlement includes a $40,000 civil penalty, a compliance management program, public outreach through a video with Chip Gaines, and a $160,000 lead-abatement project in Waco. The EPA reviewed footage from multiple seasons of the show and found noncompliance in 33 properties. Magnolia cooperated with the EPA and took steps to comply, including certification and training.\n\nPassage 2 is shorter. It states that Chip and Joanna Gaines' company will pay $40,000 to the EPA for lead-paint violations in Waco. The EPA noticed the violations by reviewing the show, and the settlement includes producing lead-awareness content. The video is to be ready by July 5. It mentions the 33 homes but notes they probably look better now.\n\nPassage 3 adds more details. The couple agreed to a $40,000 fine (could have been $556k), the settlement requires an educational video within 90 days, and a $160k lead-abatement project in Waco. The EPA's attention came from the show's popularity, with over 3 million households watching. The video was shown on March 21, 2018, and Chip Gaines promoted lead safety on Twitter. The EPA found noncompliance in 33 properties, and Magnolia took steps to comply after being contacted.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 seems to be a note about spreading the word about Science, but it's not really news. Maybe it's just a form or a disclaimer, so I can skip that.\n\nPassage 2 talks about climate changes in East Africa driving toolmaking advances and trading networks among Homo sapiens or their relatives around 320,000 years ago. They found Middle Stone Age tools and red pigment in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin. The tools are the oldest known, made from obsidian from far away, suggesting long-distance trade. The climate shifts forced hominins to forage over larger areas with smaller tools. There's a gap in the sediment layers from 499,000 to 320,000 years ago, making the transition to these tools unclear. Also, the pigment might have been used for social signaling. Experts like Rick Potts and Alison Brooks are mentioned, and they link these changes to the emergence of H. sapiens and social networking as key to survival.\n\nPassage 3 is a more detailed account of the same findings. It mentions the hand axes as innovative tools, the Middle Stone Age beginning earlier than thought, and climate stress leading to cooperation between groups. They found obsidian tools and pigments, indicating trade and social networks. The researchers suggest that during climate instability, groups formed networks to share resources, similar to modern human behavior. Alison Brooks talks about maintaining contacts through marriage or gifts, and Potts links the geological changes to the need for mobility and innovation.\n\nPassage 4 discusses the \"human revolution\" previously thought to be around 40,000 years ago, but new evidence shows advanced behaviors in the Middle Stone Age, like tools and pigments, dating back 300,000 years. This challenges the idea that modern behaviors emerged outside Africa. Sally McBrearty and Allison Brooks argued against the Eurocentric view, and the Olorgesailie findings support that. The climate changes forced adaptation, leading to technological and cultural innovations. The transition from Acheulean to Middle Stone Age tools is linked to Homo sapiens' evolution. However, the connection between these tools and H. sapiens isn't certain yet. The presence of obsidian and ochre shows long-distance trade and social networks. The summary also mentions that", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

The search is intensifying with up to 10 military planes, two civil aircraft, and 13 ships. They're searching three areas about 2,000 km northwest of Perth. However, there's no confirmation yet that the signals are from MH370. They mention white objects spotted near the signal area, but no link to the plane. The handheld hydrophone used by the Chinese is less advanced than the US Navy's towed locator. Also, the black box batteries are expected to die by day 30, which is approaching. Experts are cautious, saying it's a \"fleeting acoustic event\" and could be a false signal. Some are hopeful, but others are skeptical.\n\nPassage 2 reinforces the signal detection by the Chinese ship, same frequency as the black box. It mentions the location (25S, 101E) and that there's no confirmation. The Australian coordinator says the signals are consistent with the black box but not confirmed. The search is in its most intensive phase, with many ships and planes. The area is based on satellite data analysis. Malaysia set up committees and international teams.

They mention the author's experience at Apple keynotes since 1998, witnessing the removal of other components like the CD drive and 30-pin connector. The key issue here is Phil Schiller's justification for removing the headphone jack, using the word \"courage.\" The author criticizes this as hubris, arrogance, and greed, arguing that there's no technological reason for the change. They also mention the inconvenience of using Lightning cables and the introduction of AirPods, which are criticized for being expensive and prone to loss. \n\nIn the second passage, the content is identical to the first, so I need to make sure not to repeat the same points. The author also points out the lack of space as a reason, but questions the relevance of the Taptic engine to average users. They mention other devices that used the headphone jack, like Square's credit card dongles, and the impact on users who need wired headphones. The conclusion is that Apple's move is a step back, creating a walled garden that users have to pay for.\n\nNow, I need to condense this into a one-page summary.

Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about United Airlines updating their boarding process. They're reducing the number of boarding lanes from five to two. This is supposed to reduce congestion and speed up boarding. They tested this in Chicago and Houston gates, and now it's official. Priority passengers like elites and credit card holders are in groups 1 and 2 using lane 1, while others use lane 2. They also introduced push notifications for app users. The previous system had five lanes but caused congestion. Competitors like American use two lanes, Delta uses four. United's top elites can pre-board before the official process starts, which is a new feature.\n\nPassage 2 is about a joint business agreement between United, Avianca, and Copa. They plan to create a revenue-sharing network for routes between the US and 19 Latin American countries. Benefits include more routes, nonstop flights, reduced travel times, and better service. They need government approval and antitrust immunity. The JBA is expected to boost competition and economic growth. They're excluding Brazil for now but might add it later.\n\nPassage 3 mentions that United is addressing overcrowding at gates due to full flights. They reduced boarding lines to two and use groups 1-5. Passengers are told to wait until their group is called. They send mobile notifications to avoid gate congestion. Previously, people queued an hour before flights, causing more crowding. Maria Walter from United notes the congestion was a problem.\n\nPassage 4 details the new two-lane boarding process. Lane 1 is blue for elites and priority passengers, lane 2 is green for others. Groups 1 and 2 board first, then 3-5. They tested this in LA since February and now rolling out nationwide. Airlines like American and Delta did similar changes. Southwest has a different system. The process aims to reduce stress and crowding, but challenges remain with elite passengers clustering in early groups. Customer feedback led to the change, and they want to balance boarding groups.\n\nNow, I need to combine all these points into a concise summary.

That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

The department had issues with racial profiling and previous harassment allegations at 207 Quikstop. Johnson had a good reputation in Miami Gardens but was a new chief there after serving in North Miami as chief and city manager.\n\nPassage 3 provides more context on Johnson's mission to repair the police department's relationship with the community. His arrest followed protests over the shooting of Lavall Hall. The city manager, Cameron Benson, fired him quickly, and the department's statement emphasized moving forward.

Over time, she took him in, and they eventually became mother and son. The story details their journey from teacher-student to family, including Cruz's difficult home life with an abusive stepfather, the incident that led to him staying with the Hoopers, and the adoption process.

It also includes quotes from both Linda and Cruz, highlighting their relationship and the impact of the adoption.\n\nNow, I need to combine the information from all three passages. The main story is about Linda Hooper and Cruz Riojas. The key elements are: initial conflict, Cruz's troubled background, the turning point when Hooper took him in, their growing relationship, the adoption, and the positive outcomes. I should make sure to mention the abuse at home, the role of the Hooper family, the special education challenges, and the eventual adoption. Also, include the current status of Cruz and his family. The second passage about Alexa can be a brief mention as a separate news item. I need to keep it concise, one page, so around 500-600 words. Avoid repetition and ensure all important details are covered without getting too detailed. Check for any unique points in Passage 3 that aren't in Passage 1, like Cruz's education and marriage.

He also caused trouble in school and was known as a “holy terror,” says Linda Hooper, a teacher who first encountered Cruz in the early ‘80s, when he was 12 years old. But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated. More than a decade later, he was still part of the Hooper family—but he wanted to make it official by asking the Hoopers to adopt him right before his 30th birthday. “He said he wanted to honor us, and it was a big honor,\" Hooper tells Today. \"I’ve always known he loved me, but this really showed he loved us.” The adoption went through in 1998, but Cruz \"was my son from the day I kept him,” Hooper says.

He's blaming them for his drop in polls, calling them \"disgusting\" and saying they're protecting Hillary Clinton. He specifically targets The New York Times, accusing them of using anonymous sources and fabricating stories. He also mentions that his rallies aren't covered properly, not showing crowd size or enthusiasm. There's mention of him threatening to take away reporters' credentials and even saying the newspaper is going to hell. His relationship with the media has been tense, denying credentials to some outlets.\n\nPassage 2 covers Trump's campaign plans. He's going to end nation-building and focus on foreign policy realism, targeting ISIS and other terrorists. He'll propose a new immigration policy with visa restrictions and an ideological test for immigrants. Also, Vice President Biden is attacking Trump as the most uninformed nominee, focusing on his lack of preparedness and security knowledge. Hillary Clinton's campaign is trying to mobilize undocumented immigrants (DREAMERS) by opposing Trump's deportation promises, aiming to attract Latino voters.\n\nPassage 3 seems to be a continuation of Trump's media criticism, but it's shorter. It mentions that Trump claims the media wants him to lose, similar to past Republican nominees, but the difference is that Trump's attacks are more intense. However, the passage cuts off, so I need to note that.\n\nPassage 4 talks about a New York Times investigation into Paul Manafort's work with Ukraine's pro-Russia party. Manafort is linked to a network that looted assets and influenced elections. Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager, tweeted about the article, which caused a stir on Twitter. There's some back-and-forth between Lewandowski and Manafort, and mentions of Lewandowski's current job at CNN.\n\nNow, I need to synthesize all these points into a coherent summary.

He had a surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital where his ears were created from his own ribs. The procedure was primarily cosmetic, but he already had hearing aids from previous surgeries, so he can hear some sounds. His parents were very happy with the result, and the surgery helped him feel more confident at school. The surgeon, Neil Bulstrode, used his mother's ear shape as a template. There's also mention of future research using stem cells to grow ears, which would be less invasive.\n\nPassage 2 seems to be a follow-up or a different angle.

He wants to look like his friends and wear sunglasses and earphones. His mother wants him to be accepted. The surgeon used his mother's ear shape again.

The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs.

They mention water loss, with the polar reservoirs having up to 8 VSMOW, implying early Mars had a 137m deep water layer. \n\nPassage 2 is about a massive ancient ocean covering nearly half the northern hemisphere, equivalent to the Atlantic. The study used infrared telescopes over six years, analyzing water isotopes. They found deuterium enrichment due to water loss, leading to estimates of a 137m global ocean, but more water pooled in the northern plains. The ocean lasted millions of years, then receded as Mars lost atmosphere and warmth. Scientists suggest Mars was habitable, though life's existence is uncertain. Mention of Curiosity rover and methane detection is also there.\n\nPassage 3 reinforces the ancient ocean theory, using water vapor analysis. Earth and Mars started with similar H/D ratios, but Mars lost ordinary hydrogen, leading to higher D/H. Calculations suggest enough water for a 137m ocean, likely in the northern hemisphere. James Kasting notes the minimum estimate, possibly more water existed. The atmosphere's heavy hydrogen content might affect calculations, but the evidence supports Mars being wetter and warmer in the past, increasing life possibility.\n\nNow, I need to combine these points into a concise summary. Start with the main findings: ancient oceans, water loss, D/H ratios, implications for habitability. Mention the methods used (telescopes, isotopic analysis). Highlight the depth estimates, the location of the ocean, and the timeline (4.5 billion years ago). Also include the debate about the minimum vs. actual water volume and the connection to potential life. Make sure to note the current state of water locked in polar caps and the future missions like Exomars. Avoid redundancy between passages, and keep it within one page.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision.

{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of all the given news passages. Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about how T. rex didn't roar like in movies. The article mentions that Hollywood used sounds from baby elephants, tigers, and alligators to create the T. rex roar. Scientists now think dinosaurs might have made bird-like sounds, like coos or murmurs, using closed-mouth vocalizations. They reference a study in the journal Evolution, suggesting that large-bodied dinosaurs could have had similar vocal abilities to large birds like ostriches and cassowaries. The study also notes that closed-mouth sounds are low-frequency and produced using an esophageal pouch. However, since soft tissues don't fossilize, there's no direct evidence, so conclusions are based on bird comparisons.\n\nPassage 2 is a rerun from 2013 about the sound design for Jurassic Park. Gary Rydstrom, the sound designer, explains how he created dinosaur sounds by combining sounds from various animals. For example, the Dilophosaurus used swan sounds for the cute version and rattlesnake and hawk sounds for the scary version. He also mentions using an assistant to record dangerous animals, which is a fun fact about the process.\n\nPassage 3 is about web collections by Mark Graham using Archive-IT. It seems unrelated to the other passages, so maybe it's just a note about the source or a collection of websites. I can probably skip this since it doesn't provide new information on dinosaurs or sounds.\n\nPassage 4 is a scientific study discussing closed-mouth vocalizations in birds. It explains that these vocalizations are used in territorial or courtship displays, produce low-frequency sounds, and are more common in large-bodied birds. The study suggests that this behavior evolved independently multiple times in archosaurs, including dinosaurs, which might have used similar methods for mating displays.\n\nPassage 5 is another study from the same journal as Passage 1, reinforcing the idea that some dinosaurs had closed-mouth vocalizations. It mentions the collaboration between universities and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The study found that 52 out of 208 bird species use closed-mouth vocalizations, which are linked to larger body sizes. The researchers suggest that dinosaurs, being archosaurs with large bodies, might have used similar techniques. They also mention future research integrating fossils and physiology to better understand dinosaur sounds.\n\nNow, I need to combine all these points", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The group’s $50,000 donation in 1933 helped build the dorm.

The attacks, attributed to rebels seeking to topple President Bashar Assad’s regime, were reported by state-run media and witnesses. One explosion was a car bomb, while another involved an explosive device near the Omayyad Square, a landmark area. The blasts shattered windows of nearby buildings, including the Dama Rose hotel, and sent thick black smoke billowing over the capital for hours. Despite the chaos, Syrian authorities claimed no military commanders or personnel were injured, though several guards were wounded. However, Iranian Press TV correspondent Maya Nasser, a Syrian national, died in crossfire following the blasts.  \n\nThe attacks", "answers": ["Damascus has been rocked by bombings for the past two days, with at least two large blasts hitting Syria's military headquarters there this morning. The Free Syrian Army claimed responsibility for the attack, said to be the largest since July explosions killed President Bashar al-Assad's brother-in-law and other key aides; the BBC reports that Assad would have been able to hear today's explosions from his palace. Gunfire broke out afterward, and Maya Nasser, a TV correspondent for the Iranian Press TV, was shot dead by sniper fire during a live broadcast, report the New York Times and Press TV. Other government facilities were hit by bombs yesterday, proving the opposition can still get past government security, but the regime is downplaying the scope of the attacks while the opposition says many of Assad's forces have been killed.

Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope. Those along the Pacific Rim from Alaska and northwestern Canada to central and eastern Asia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Australia will get the best view of totality during the middle of the night. However, partial phases of the eclipse should be visible under a clear sky in central North America, western Asia, India, the Middle East and eastern Europe, per Space.com. North American viewers should look up as the moon sets on the morning of Jan. 31, while those on the opposite side of the world should see a partial eclipse as the moon rises.

While the GPS’s instructions were technically correct, the driver’s quick reaction caused the car to veer off the road and become entangled in the guy wire supporting a telephone pole.  \n\nState Police confirmed that neither Altahan nor her passenger sustained injuries in the incident. The driver reportedly exited the vehicle as it hung suspended from the pole, with witnesses at the nearby miniature golf course observing the event. Ray Ault, a photographer who was driving past the scene at the time, noted the police and Rutland City Fire Department responded to the situation.  \n\nThe incident highlights the potential risks of relying on GPS navigation systems, particularly when drivers react impulsively to sudden directional changes.
