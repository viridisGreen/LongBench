However, I don't see a specific number mentioned for the number of sentences. \n\nIn the \"Approach\" section under \"Features ::: Word embeddings,\" they talk about training word embeddings on a corpus and mention the dataset created", "answers": ["3606", "6946"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2835}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking which models or frameworks the authors compare their proposed s2sL approach to. I need to check the article to find any mentions of comparisons.\n\nLooking through the sections, the article mentions that they validate their approach using MLP as the base classifier and discuss training with s2s data representation. In the experiments section, they mention using the GTZAN dataset for speech/music discrimination and emotion classification. However, the article doesn't explicitly state that they compare their method to other existing models or frameworks. They talk about the problem of low data resources and their novel approach, but there's", "answers": ["MLP", "Eusboost, MWMOTE"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2474}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if their NER model learns from both text and images. I need to check the article to find the answer.\n\nLooking through the introduction, they mention that social media posts have text and images, and they use auxiliary modalities like images for context. The proposed methods include combining word embeddings, character embeddings, and visual features. The model is called a multimodal NER network that takes both image and text. The results section also talks about performance improvements when visual contexts are included. The conclusion states they combined visual and textual info to outperform text-only baselines. \n\nSo,", "answers": ["Yes", "Yes"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3784}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking whether they evaluate only on English datasets. I need to check the article to find out.\n\nLooking through the article, in the \"Experiments\" section, they mention evaluating on the Penn Treebank, which is a corpus of English text. They also talk about using unsupervised POS tags induced from their Markov-structured model. Additionally, when discussing the parsing model, they mention using the WSJ (Wall Street Journal) dataset, which is also English. \n\nHowever, the article doesn't explicitly state that they only use English datasets. It's possible they might have tested", "answers": ["Yes", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4320}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the highest MRR score achieved by their system. I need to look through the article to find any mention of MRR scores.\n\nLooking at the introduction, it says they scored near the top for factoid questions and specifically mentions that in the third test batch, their system achieved the highest 'MRR' score for the Factoid Question Answering task. Then later, in the experiments section, it states that their BioBERT model achieved an MRR score of 0.6103 in one of the test batches for Factoid questions. \n\nWait, the article", "answers": ["0.5115", "0.6103"], "all_classes": null, "length": 6810}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what datasets they evaluated their approach on. I need to look through the article to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the \"Experiments\" section, the article mentions they evaluate on two tasks: part-of-speech (POS) induction and unsupervised dependency parsing. Specifically, it says they use the Penn Treebank (BIBREF13) for experiments. The Penn Treebank is a well-known dataset in NLP, so that's likely the answer. \n\nWait, the question is about datasets, so the answer should be the Penn Treebank. The article also mentions", "answers": [" Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4327}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how the authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models, and optimization techniques.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the article. The article talks about challenges engineers face when using DNN models for NLP tasks. It mentions that existing frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras are flexible but require a large overhead of mastering framework details. The authors then introduce NeuronBlocks as a toolkit to address these issues by providing higher-level abstractions.\n\nThe key part here is the section under \"Related Work\" where they discuss existing", "answers": ["By conducting a survey among engineers", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1692}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking on which benchmarks the authors achieved state-of-the-art results. I need to check the article for that information.\n\nLooking through the article, there's a section titled \"KBQA End-Task Results\". Table 3 compares their system with baselines. The article mentions that their method improves the KBQA end task by 2-3% compared to the baseline. Then, in the conclusion, it says their system achieves state-of-the-art results. \n\nWait, in the \"Relation Detection Results\" section, they mention that their HR-BiLSTM outperformed baselines", "answers": ["SimpleQuestions, WebQSP", "WebQSP, SimpleQuestions"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4524}
