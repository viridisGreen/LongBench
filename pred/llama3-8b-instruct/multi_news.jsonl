Researchers at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have found that cigarette smoke not only harms human respiratory and immune cells but also makes MRSA more resistant to antibiotics and more aggressive in its invasion of human cells.\n\nAccording to the studies, MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract becomes more resistant to the reactive oxygen species and antimicrobial peptides used by the immune system to kill pathogens. This increased resistance allows the bacteria to adhere better to human cells, making it easier for them to invade and cause infections. The study also found that the effects of cigarette smoke on MRSA can last for up to 24 hours, suggesting that the bacteria can inherit this resistance.\n\nIn lab studies, researchers found that MRSA exposed to cigarette smoke extract was four times more resistant to macrophage killing than non-exposed MRSA. The study also showed that cigarette smoke-exposed MRSA became more resistant to antimicrobial peptides, which pierce bacterial cell walls. Furthermore, the smoke-exposed MRSA became better at invading human cells in lab cultures and caused a significant increase in mortality in mice.\n\nThe findings of these studies suggest that cigarette smoke may be an additional contributing factor to the increased susceptibility of smokers to infectious diseases. The researchers hope that their findings will add to the growing body of evidence that highlights the dangers of smoking and the importance of quitting.\n\nIn a related study, researchers found that e-cigarette vapor also made MRSA more resistant, but to a lesser extent than cigarette smoke.

The study used a method borrowed from Google's PageRank algorithm to analyze links between Wikipedia pages. Initially, the study found that Frank Sinatra was the most important person, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when the study was expanded to include 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, the results changed, with Adolf Hitler taking the top spot, followed by Michael Jackson and Madonna.\n\nThe study aimed to discover if Wikipedia's level of attention to various figures was skewed by factors such as gender, time, or location. The researchers found that most important historical figures on Wikipedia are born in Western countries after the 17th century and are male. However, each Wikipedia edition highlights local figures, making them more prominent in their respective languages.\n\nThe study also used a second method, CheiRank, which measures the number of outgoing links from a page. By combining PageRank and CheiRank, the researchers developed a new measure called 2DRank, which led to a different result. According to 2DRank, Frank Sinatra was the most important person in the world.\n\nHowever, a separate study by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom, published in a different context, found that the most influential thinker in the world is actually Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist who is known as the \"Father of Taxonomy.\" Linnaeus' system of naming species is still widely used today, and his influence can be seen in the many Wikipedia pages that reference his work. The study found that Linnaeus' influence extends far beyond his own field, making him the most influential thinker in the world.\n\nThe Internet Archive is also working to preserve Wikipedia pages and the links they contain. The organization is using crawlers to archive pages as they are created and to preserve the pages that they reference. This will help to fix broken links on the web and provide a way for people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.\n\nIn a broader context, the concept of influence and importance is complex and multifaceted.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The features, designed to enhance user experience and provide personalized recommendations, have raised concerns about data collection and privacy.\n\n**Samsung's Smart TVs**\n\nSamsung's new smart TVs have a voice recognition feature that allows users to control their TVs with voice commands. However, the company's privacy policy has sparked controversy, as it allows Samsung and its partners to listen in on users' conversations and collect sensitive information. The policy states that users' spoken words, including personal and sensitive information, will be captured and transmitted to third-party companies. While users can turn off the voice recognition feature, the TV will still collect data on how users interact with the device.\n\n**Microsoft's Xbox One**\n\nMicrosoft's new Xbox One console also has an always-on listening feature, which allows users to control the device with voice commands, even when it's turned off. The Kinect peripheral, which comes with the console, can read users' heartbeats and recognize individual voices. While Microsoft claims that the feature is designed to provide a more natural and responsive user experience, it has raised concerns about data collection and potential privacy threats.\n\n**Comparison to 1984**\n\nBoth Samsung and Microsoft's features have been compared to George Orwell's dystopian novel 1984, where the government has complete control over citizens' lives and monitors their every move. While the features are not as invasive as those in the novel, they have sparked concerns about the potential for companies to collect and use users' data for their own purposes.\n\n**Concerns and Safeguards**\n\nBoth companies have responded to concerns about their features, with Samsung stating that data is encrypted and users can disconnect their TVs from the internet to keep their data safe.

The condition, which affects the nervous system and causes muscle weakness, paralysis, and respiratory failure, has been linked to viral infections such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus.\n\n**Symptoms and Diagnosis**\n\nAFM symptoms include pain in the arms and legs, inability to pass urine, and respiratory failure, which can require urgent ventilator support. The exact trigger of AFM is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment, although neurologists may prescribe therapy on a case-by-case basis. Diagnosis is typically made through a combination of clinical evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and laboratory tests.\n\n**Outbreaks and Cases**\n\nThe current outbreak of AFM coincides with an increase in enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) cases, which was also linked to a similar outbreak in 2014. In 2014, 120 cases of AFM were reported, mostly among children under the age of 21. The average age of patients with AFM is 7, and most have had a respiratory or febrile illness before developing neurologic symptoms.\n\n**Investigation and Prevention**\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is investigating the current outbreak and has issued health alerts to states to encourage timely reporting of cases. The CDC advises people to wash their hands frequently, avoid close contact with sick people, and clean surfaces with a disinfectant to prevent the spread of the illness. There are no vaccines available for the strain of enterovirus linked to AFM.\n\n**Personal Stories**\n\nSeveral families have shared their personal stories of dealing with AFM, including the Roberts family, whose 3-year-old son, Carter, was diagnosed with AFM in July 2016.

The study, published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, used a technique called Bloodstain Pattern Analysis to examine the bloodstains on the shroud and compare them to the patterns that would be expected if the cloth had been used to wrap a crucified person.\n\nThe researchers, led by Matteo Borrini and Luigi Garlaschelli, used real and synthetic blood samples to test the orientation of stains on the cloth, and found that the bloodstains are inconsistent with any one pose. They concluded that the linen appears to have been patched with bloodstains from a standing model, rather than a crucified man or a facedown corpse. This suggests that the shroud may be a medieval forgery, rather than a genuine relic from the time of Jesus.\n\nThe researchers conducted seven different bloodstain tests on different body parts depicted on the fabric, including the hand, forearm, chest, and lower back. They found that the angle at which gravity would pull blood dripping from a body in the way seen on the shroud varied with the body part. For example, the forearm rivulets corresponded to an arm held straight out around 90 degrees to the side, while the hand marks matched an arm held out at about 45 degrees. Some hand bloodstains traced angles at odds with each other as well, off by as much as 10 degrees.\n\nThe study's findings are significant because they suggest that the shroud is not a genuine death shroud, but rather a medieval forgery.

The rebels are divided into two groups: the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and Ansar Dine, which is linked to the North African branch of al-Qaeda. Ansar Dine wants to impose Sharia law in the region.\n\n**Regional Response**\n\nWest African leaders, led by Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, have formed a diplomatic emergency committee to pressure the junta to relinquish power.

The movement, led by the charity Lumos, aims to keep families together and provide support to vulnerable families to prevent children from being taken away from their families and locked in institutions.\n\nThe issue of child institutionalization is a pressing one, with an estimated 8 million children worldwide being separated from their families due to poverty, disability, and discrimination. However, the majority of these children have parents who could care for them, but are unable to due to lack of resources or support. The consequences of institutionalization are severe, with children facing malnutrition, abuse, and trauma, and often struggling to thrive in adulthood.\n\nLumos, founded by author JK Rowling, has been working to address this issue since 2007, with significant successes in countries such as Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria. In Moldova, the number of children in institutions has decreased by 70% since Lumos began working there, while in the Czech Republic, admissions to institutions have fallen by 75% in a demonstration area. In Bulgaria, the number of children in institutions has decreased by 54%, and the number of foster carers has increased by 440%.\n\nThe solution to this problem is not just a moral imperative, but also economically sound. Supporting children in families is far more cost-effective than institutionalizing them, and reduces long-term costs by preventing dependency in adulthood. International donors play a crucial role in this effort, and their support can make a significant difference in the lives of children and families.\n\nTo raise awareness and create a global movement to end child institutionalization, Lumos has launched the #Letstalklumos campaign, which encourages people to share their stories and experiences on social media. The campaign aims to create a critical mass of expertise and evidence to support the eradication of institutionalization by 2050.\n\nWith the support of international donors, governments, and individuals, it is possible to create a world where children are kept with their families and communities, and where they can thrive and reach their full potential.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The building, which was used for gatherings and feasts, was found to have been abandoned in a clean and organized manner, suggesting that it was not a permanent residence. The site has yielded a wealth of artifacts, including flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets, and a Roman brooch. Analysis of the finds suggests that the site was used for status and power displays, with the ability to mobilize a massive workforce being a key factor in its construction.\n\n**Wilsford Henge: A 4,000-Year-Old Child's Remains**\n\nAt Wilsford Henge, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child, was discovered by archaeologists from the University of Reading.

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago during the Jurassic Period, is a crow-sized, bird-like creature with colorful feathers that shimmered and shifted in the light, similar to those of hummingbirds.\n\nThe discovery was made by a team of researchers led by paleontologist Xing Xu, who found the fossil in Hebei Province, China. The fossil is exceptionally well-preserved, with the dinosaur's feathers, bones, and even its internal organs still intact. The researchers used powerful microscopes to study the feathers and found that they contained microscopic structures called melanosomes, which are responsible for pigmentation.\n\nThe melanosomes in Caihong's feathers were found to be similar to those of hummingbirds, which have iridescent feathers that change color depending on the angle of the light. The researchers believe that Caihong's feathers may have had a similar effect, giving the dinosaur a rainbow-like appearance.\n\nCaihong's body was found to be a mix of bird-like and reptilian features, with a bird-like body, but a crested head that resembles that of a Velociraptor. The dinosaur had a frond-like tail with asymmetrical feathers, which would have been ideal for flight. It is now the oldest known animal to have this key adaptation.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong has shed new light on the evolution of feathers and their role in the lives of dinosaurs. It is believed that feathers originally evolved for display purposes, and later took on the traits needed for flight. The discovery of Caihong's iridescent feathers suggests that some dinosaurs may have used their feathers for social or sexual displays, similar to modern birds.\n\nThe researchers are still unsure how Caihong used its iridescent feathers, or whether males or females of the species had different plumage. However, the discovery of Caihong has opened up new avenues of research into the evolution of feathers and the lives of dinosaurs.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong juji has been published in the journal Nature Communications, and has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the field of paleontology. The discovery has also sparked new questions about the evolution of feathers and their role in the lives of dinosaurs, and is expected to lead to further research and discoveries in the field.", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree. And \"glide\" is the operative word, as this dinosaur likely didn't fly: Its feathers were located on its tail, not on its wings like birds, Discover notes.

It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Many people who come to the area to work in the cannabis industry often go off the grid for extended periods, making it hard to determine whether they are missing or not.\n\nThe Humboldt County Sheriff's Office and the Eureka Police Department have implemented measures to address the issue, including using the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System (NamUs) to track missing persons cases and working with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) to identify and locate missing children.\n\nHowever, the process of searching for missing individuals can be frustrating for families, as seen in the case of Vikki Joseph, whose brother Jeff disappeared in 2014 while working in the cannabis industry. Despite her efforts to investigate and gather information, Vikki Joseph has been unable to find any leads or closure.\n\nThe issue of missing persons in Humboldt County is complex and multifaceted, and it requires a collaborative effort from law enforcement, families, and the community to address.

Myrna Arias, who worked for Intermex from February to May 2014, claims that her boss, John Stubits, required her to download the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which tracked her location, speed, and routes taken, both during and outside of work hours.\n\nArias objected to the app's GPS function during non-work hours, likening it to a prisoner's ankle bracelet, and informed Stubits that his actions were illegal. However, Stubits allegedly told her to tolerate the intrusion, stating that Intermex was paying her more than her previous employer, NetSpend. When Arias uninstalled the app to protect her privacy, Stubits scolded her and eventually fired her a few weeks later.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Kern County Superior Court, alleges invasion of privacy, retaliation, unfair business practices, and other claims, seeking damages in excess of $500,000. Arias' attorney, Gail Glick, stated that an employer can legally monitor employees at work if there is a legitimate business interest, but if an employee cannot stop it, it is a complete violation of California and federal laws against invasion of privacy.\n\nThe case highlights the growing concern over employee monitoring and the use of location-tracking apps in the workplace.

The film stars Saoirse Ronan as Susie, Stanley Tucci as George Harvey, and Mark Wahlberg and Rachel Weisz as Susie's parents.\n\nWhile the film has its moments, critics argue that it fails to capture the complexity and tone of the novel.

Senate Democrats, however, have vowed to reject any changes to the law, and President Barack Obama has threatened to veto such a bill. House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) is under pressure from conservative Republicans to take a hardline stance against the ACA, but he also faces opposition from Senate Democrats and the White House.\n\n**Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Takes a Hardline Stance**\n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) has taken a firm stance against the House's proposal, urging President Obama not to engage in negotiations with House Republicans.

Local economist Stephen Fuller estimates that the region could lose $200 million a day and see over 700,000 jobs affected. The shutdown could also lead to cuts in federal services, including new applications for benefits, housing and small-business loans, and clinical trials for research funded by the National Institutes of Health.\n\n**Local Governments Prepare for a Shutdown**\n\nLocal governments in the Washington region are preparing for a shutdown by setting aside funds to mitigate the effects. Maryland officials estimate that the state could lose $5 million a day in income tax revenue, while Prince George's County officials say they could lose $270,000 daily.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Parker, who is still alive, predicted the existence of solar wind in 1958, a discovery that revolutionized our understanding of the sun and interplanetary space. The Parker Solar Probe is set to launch in July 2018 and will be the first spacecraft to fly directly into the sun's corona, the outer layer of the sun's atmosphere. The spacecraft will travel within 3.7 million miles of the sun's surface, closer than any other spacecraft has ever been, and will have to withstand temperatures of up to 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe mission aims to answer two long-standing puzzles: how the solar wind is accelerated and why the sun's corona is hotter than its surface. The spacecraft will be equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from the sun's heat and radiation, and will use a thermal protection system and solar array cooling system to keep its instruments at a safe temperature.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will make 24 close flybys of the sun, using the gravity of Venus to shrink its orbit around the sun over the course of nearly seven years. The mission will provide unprecedented insights into the sun's behavior and will help scientists understand the physics of stars, improve space weather forecasting, and potentially protect Earth from the effects of solar storms.\n\nThe mission is expected to end in June 2025 and will be the first time a spacecraft has been named for a living person. Eugene Parker, who is 89 years old, was presented with a model of the probe and NASA's distinguished public service medal during a press conference at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe will carry a chip with photos of Parker and his revolutionary paper, as well as a plate carrying an inscription of his choice. The mission's objectives include tracing the flow of energy that heats and accelerates the sun's corona and solar wind, determining the structure and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind, and exploring mechanisms that accelerate and transport energetic particles.\n\nThe mission is expected to provide a wealth of new information about the sun and its behavior, and will help scientists better understand the complex interactions between the sun and the Earth.

According to reports, Neiman Marcus's computer network was penetrated by hackers as far back as July, with the breach not being fully contained until January 1. The company disclosed the data theft of customer information late last week, stating that some customers' payment cards were used fraudulently after making purchases at their stores. Neiman Marcus has apologized for the breach and has offered customers one free year of credit monitoring.\n\nIn a similar incident, Target Corp. was also hit by a massive data breach that compromised 40 million credit- and debit-card accounts, as well as personal information belonging to 70 million people. A 17-page report from computer firm iSight, filed to the U.S. Secret Service, details the type of software used in the hack, which was caused by a type of malware placed in store's point-of-sale systems. The report notes that the malware was effective and was used to steal credit and debit card data for tens of millions of customers.\n\nThe report also suggests that the malware was created in regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist, including Eastern Europe and Brazil. The tactic used during the Target holiday hackers is \"new to eCrime\" and \"covertly subverts network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers.\" The report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach.\n\nA report prepared by federal and private investigators suggests that the Target breach was part of a broad and highly sophisticated international hacking campaign against multiple retailers.

The lion had been surrounded by a crowd of people, who had been taunting and stoning it for hours before the rangers arrived.\n\nMohawk was a beloved attraction in the park, known for his distinctive black mane and his habit of roaming freely among tourists. However, the park's infrastructure, including a faulty electric fence, has been criticized for contributing to the lion's escape. The Kenya Wildlife Service has said that the lion was killed as a last resort, after it became agitated and attacked the man.\n\nIn a separate incident, a lion named Sylvester escaped from Karoo National Park in South Africa and was being hunted by wildlife officials. The officials had initially planned to kill the lion, but later reconsidered and are now considering various options, including relocating it to another park or donating it to a conservation group.\n\nThe incidents have sparked an outcry among Kenyans and conservationists, who are calling for more humane treatment of the animals. The Kenya Wildlife Service has said that it is unsure why there is a surge in lion escapes, but conservationists attribute it to habitat loss and the encroachment of development projects on the park.\n\nThe African lion is considered a vulnerable species, with its population having declined by 50% in the past 20 years.

The team's research, published in the Astronomical Journal, suggests that the planet's existence can be inferred from the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked a new debate about the definition of a planet, with some arguing that it should be classified as a planet and others arguing that it should not. However, Brown and his team believe that the evidence for Planet Nine's existence is strong and that it meets the criteria for a planet, including having a massive enough size to clear its orbital zone.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also reignited the debate about Pluto's status as a planet. Brown, who was a key figure in Pluto's demotion, has stated that he has no regrets about his role in the decision and believes that Pluto's status as a dwarf planet is a more accurate reflection of its place in the solar system.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding Pluto's status, Brown believes that the discovery of Planet Nine is an exciting development that will help us better understand the solar system. He hopes that the discovery will spark a new era of exploration and research into the outer reaches of the solar system.\n\nThe search for Planet Nine is ongoing, with telescopes on at least two continents searching for the object. While it is difficult to predict when or if the planet will be spotted, Brown and his team are optimistic that it will be discovered within the next few years.\n\nIn related news, NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, has cautioned that the discovery of Planet Nine is still a topic of debate and that more evidence is needed to confirm its existence.

The issue occurred on Wednesday when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down due to a malfunctioning flow control valve. The valve caused the loop to produce too much ammonia, forcing NASA to reroute coolant into the other loop, Loop-B.\n\nAs a result, the station's crew had to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems, and science experiments, including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in the NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab, and Europe's Columbus lab. The crew worked to keep the freezers operational, but the situation has required a cutback in normal operations on the orbiting outpost.\n\nNASA officials have stated that the crew was never in any danger, but the situation has been classified as a \"Big 14\" maintenance issue, which is a type of problem that NASA and its partners expect to face on an occasional basis during space station operations.

{"pred": "**Rising Colorectal Cancer Rates Among Younger Adults: A Growing Concern**\n\nA recent study has shed light on a concerning trend in the United States: colorectal cancer rates are increasing among younger adults, with one in seven cases diagnosed in individuals under the age of 50. This is a significant departure from the traditional perception of colorectal cancer as a disease primarily affecting older adults.\n\nAccording to the study, which analyzed data from over 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer between 1998 and 2011, nearly 15% of cases were diagnosed in individuals under 50. Younger patients were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage cancer, but they also tended to live slightly longer without a cancer recurrence due to aggressive treatment.\n\nResearchers found that younger patients were more likely to undergo surgery and radiation therapy than older patients, with 72% of those under 50 receiving surgery and 53% receiving radiation therapy. Despite having more advanced cancer, younger patients had a higher five-year survival rate, with 95.1% of those with localized disease, 76% with regional disease, and 21.3% with distant disease surviving compared to older patients.\n\nThe study's lead author, Dr. Samantha Hendren, emphasized the need for improved risk assessment and screening decisions for younger adults. She noted that the medical community should be on the lookout for warning signs of colorectal cancer, such as anemia, bowel bleeding, or a blockage in the colon.\n\nExperts agree that the reasons for the increase in colorectal cancer among younger adults are unclear, but possible contributing factors include environmental factors, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and a poor diet. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase may be due to an environmental effect that is contributing to the rise in colon cancer.\n\nThe study's findings raise questions about whether screening for colon cancer should begin at an earlier age. While some experts argue that the risk is still low, others suggest that the medical community should be prepared for the increasing number of young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\n\nUltimately, the study highlights the need for increased awareness and vigilance in detecting colorectal cancer among younger adults, as well as a reevaluation of current screening guidelines to ensure that they are effective in preventing cancer deaths.", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says. More screenings for young people might help, but the yield would be low because under-50s are still less likely to get colon cancer. \"This would be a big and costly change,\" says Hendren, who recommends \"a lot of research\" be done first.

The site, known as Warratyi, was discovered by chance when an archaeologist, Giles Hamm, and an Aboriginal elder, Clifford Coulthard, were surveying the area. The site contains a rock shelter with a blackened roof, indicating human activity, and has yielded a treasure trove of artefacts and bones, including the earliest known use of ochre in Australia and South-East Asia.\n\nThe discovery pushes back the earliest known dates on the development of key technologies such as bone and stone axe technologies and the use of ochre. The site also provides reliably dated evidence of human interaction with megafauna, including the Diprotodon optatum, a giant wombat-like species, and a giant bird. The bones and eggs of these animals were found in the rock shelter, suggesting that early humans were living alongside and hunting them.\n\nThe discovery has significant implications for our understanding of human migration and settlement in Australia. It suggests that humans arrived in the arid interior of Australia some 10,000 years earlier than previously thought, and that they were able to adapt to the harsh environment and develop complex technologies. The site also challenges the Eurocentric view that Indigenous Australians were not as innovative as similar populations elsewhere in the world.\n\nThe Warratyi site is located in the Flinders Ranges, about 550 km north of Adelaide, and is considered one of the most important prehistoric sites in Australia. The discovery was made through a collaboration between archaeologists and the Adnyamathanha people, who have a deep connection to the land and its history.\n\nThe site has been dated using a combination of optical dating and radiocarbon dating, with the results indicating that humans occupied the site from 49,000 to 46,000 years ago. The discovery has been published in the journal Nature and is considered a significant milestone in the study of human migration and settlement in Australia.\n\nThe discovery has also sparked debate among archaeologists, with some questioning the accuracy of the dating methods used. However, the majority of experts agree that the discovery is significant and provides new insights into the history of human settlement in Australia. The Warratyi site is a testament to the ingenuity and adaptability of the first Australians, who were able to thrive in one of the harshest environments on Earth.", "answers": ["\"A man getting out of the car to go to the toilet led to the discovery of one of the most important sites in Australian pre-history,\" archaeologist Giles Hamm tells ABC News.

At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old.

Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them.

The movie begins with a semi-animated sequence that sets the stage for the mass migration of African-Americans from the rural south to the urban north and west after World War I, leading to the racial tensions that culminated in the Algiers Motel incident.\n\nThe film follows a group of characters, including Larry Reed, a rising R&B singer, and his friend Fred Simple, as they try to survive the night at the Algiers Motel, which is under siege by police officers who are looking for a sniper. The police, led by a racist and trigger-happy officer named Krauss, resort to torture and intimidation to extract confessions from the motel guests, resulting in the deaths of two more men.\n\nThe film is a scathing critique of police brutality and systemic racism, and it highlights the deep-seated anger and frustration that still exists in America today.

{"pred": "**The Quest for Energy: A Universal Expansion**\n\nA recent paper by Dan Hooper, a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, has revived the concept of galactic expansion proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. According to Kardashev's model, a civilization's energy consumption can be measured in three phases: Level I, where a civilization harnesses all of its planet's resources; Level II, where it harnesses all the radiation of a star; and Level III, where it harnesses all the resources of a galaxy.\n\nHooper's paper adds a new twist to Kardashev's model, suggesting that harvesting energy from distant stars is not only a means to increase a civilization's resources but also a way to prevent the universe from leaving it behind. As the universe expands at an accelerating rate due to dark energy, stars beyond our Local Group will become inaccessible within approximately 100 billion years. To avoid this, advanced civilizations would need to capture and harvest stars from other galaxies before they become permanently inaccessible.\n\nHooper proposes that these civilizations would use a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites, known as Dyson spheres, to capture and harness the energy of stars. This concept was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, who suggested that advanced civilizations would re-engineer their solar systems to capture their star's energy. Dyson spheres would be made up of individual solar-collecting satellites, called statites, which would hover in space and collect energy from the star, beaming it back to the home planet.\n\nThe idea of Dyson spheres has been explored in science fiction, with authors such as Olaf Stapledon and Larry Niven featuring similar concepts in their works. While humans are still in the early stages of Kardashev's Level I, there is a possibility that advanced civilizations thousands or millions of years older than ours have already reached Level III and are harvesting stars from other galaxies.\n\nHooper suggests that astronomers could detect the presence of these advanced civilizations by looking for unusual light signatures from galaxies that have had their prime stars ripped away.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The couple's company, Magnolia Homes, was found to have failed to take adequate precautions to protect against lead paint hazards in 33 homes in Waco, Texas, where their show was filmed.\n\nAccording to the EPA, the agency reviewed several seasons of Fixer Upper and found evidence of noncompliance with lead-based paint regulations.

{"pred": "Recent archaeological discoveries in East Africa have shed new light on the evolution of human behavior and technology. Excavations in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya have uncovered evidence of a significant shift in toolmaking and trading networks among early humans, dating back to around 320,000 years ago. This period marks the beginning of the Middle Stone Age, a time of great change and innovation in human history.\n\nThe discoveries suggest that early humans, likely Homo sapiens or their close relatives, responded to dramatic shifts in the East African climate by developing more advanced tools and trading networks. The tools, which include smaller, more specialized stone tools and obsidian, were made from materials sourced from far away, indicating long-distance contacts and trading among hominid populations.\n\nThe researchers propose that this shift in toolmaking and trading was driven by the need for early humans to adapt to a changing environment. The climate in the region was characterized by frequent shifts between wet and dry conditions, which would have made food sources unpredictable. In response, early humans developed more mobile and inventive ways of acquiring resources, including the use of obsidian and other exotic materials.\n\nThe discoveries also suggest that early humans were capable of complex behaviors, such as the use of pigments and the creation of art. The team found evidence of bright red ochre pigment, which was ground and cut to extract its color, and was likely used for symbolic purposes.\n\nThe findings challenge the long-held view that modern human behaviors, such as symbolism, innovation, and art, emerged suddenly around 40,000-50,000 years ago. Instead, the evidence suggests that these behaviors arose much earlier, starting in groups that predated our own species.\n\nThe discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin are significant because they provide a window into the lives of early humans in Africa, a region that has been underrepresented in the archaeological record. The findings suggest that early humans were capable of complex behaviors and technological innovation, and that these behaviors were not unique to our own species.\n\nThe researchers propose that the \"human revolution\" that made us modern never actually occurred, and that the emergence of modern human behaviors was a gradual process that occurred over hundreds of thousands of years. The discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin are a significant step towards understanding the evolution of human behavior and the development of modern human societies.", "answers": ["For decades, the human story was one told through signs of modernity—art, tools, burials—found only after Homo sapiens left Africa. Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts. Others were made of obsidian from as far as 30 miles away, per the Conversation. (These stone tools are also making waves.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3668}

However, thanks to previous operations and a hearing aid, he has been able to hear, albeit with some difficulty. The surgery was primarily cosmetic, aiming to improve Kieran's confidence and self-esteem.\n\nThe procedure, led by consultant plastic surgeon Neil Bulstrode, involved removing cartilage from six of Kieran's ribs, shaping it into ear frameworks, and then inserting them into pockets in the skin. The ears were designed to match the shape of Kieran's mother's ears, which were used as a template.\n\nThe surgery has brought significant psychological benefits to Kieran, who had struggled with bullying and low self-esteem due to his appearance. His father, David Sorkin, said that Kieran's confidence has improved exponentially, and he is now able to interact with his peers more easily.\n\nThe surgery is a major operation, but it has a significant impact on the quality of life for children with microtia.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage.

Not everyone's convinced the upcoming hearing will mean liberation for the chimps. A Pepperdine University law professor tells Science that the judge likely just wants to hear both sides of the story: \"It would be quite surprising if the judge intended to make a momentous substantive finding that chimpanzees are legal persons\" without doing so, he notes. Prosin, meanwhile, says her group isn't stopping with the chimps and will also target the release of other animals.

The raids, which took place at two Nashville facilities and one in Memphis, are related to the Lacey Act, a century-old endangered species law that was amended in 2008 to include plants as well as animals.\n\nThe Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to certify the legality of their supply chain all the way to the trees. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) has concluded that Gibson knowingly imported tainted wood from Madagascar, where a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood was in place. Gibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz denies these allegations, stating that all of its purchases from Madagascar have complied with U.S. and Malagasy law.\n\nThe case has sparked debate in the guitar world, with some supporting the Lacey Act as a necessary measure to stop unscrupulous operators and protect endangered species. Chris Martin, Chairman and CEO of the C.F. Martin Guitar Co., says that the law is a \"wonderful thing\" and that he is willing to comply with its requirements. However, others are concerned about the law's retroactive nature, which could force guitar builders to prove the provenance of wood they acquired decades ago.\n\nThe raids have also had a significant impact on the guitar industry, with some dealers and builders worried about the potential consequences of the law. Nashville's George Gruhn, a top dealer of old guitars, banjos, and other rare stringed instruments, says that the law is a \"nightmare\" and has nearly eliminated 40% of his business that dealt with overseas buyers.\n\nIn a separate development, Alexa Internet has been donating its crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, with the data being added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. This development highlights the importance of preserving online content and the role of organizations like the Internet Archive in making it possible.\n\nOverall, the Gibson Guitar raids and the Lacey Act have raised important questions about the intersection of music and environmental regulation, and the need for responsible sourcing of wood in the guitar industry.", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

{"pred": "**Ancient Mars: A Wet and Habitable Planet**\n\nRecent studies have revealed that Mars was once a warm and wet planet, with a massive ocean covering nearly half of its northern hemisphere. NASA scientists have used infrared maps to analyze the Martian atmosphere and found that the planet's water was enriched with deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen. This enrichment indicates that Mars lost a significant amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times the amount currently locked up in its frozen ice caps.\n\nThe research suggests that the ancient ocean was at least a mile deep in some areas and covered a fifth of the planet's surface, which is comparable to the size of the Atlantic Ocean on Earth. The scientists estimate that the ocean lasted for millions of years, but eventually receded and froze as the Martian atmosphere thinned and the planet lost its insulation.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for the search for life on Mars. The presence of a large ocean and a warm climate in the past increases the likelihood of habitability and the possibility of life existing on the planet. The European Space Agency's Exomars rover, set to launch in 2018, will search for chemical signatures of life on Mars, and NASA's Curiosity rover has already detected methane in the Martian atmosphere, which could be a sign of microbial life.\n\nThe study also suggests that Mars was once much wetter and warmer than it is today, with a global ocean that would have reached a depth of 137 meters if it had covered the entire planet evenly. However, it is likely that the ocean would have formed in the northern hemisphere, which has a lower altitude.\n\nThe research is based on an analysis of the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor. The scientists used powerful telescopes to measure the sunlight reflecting off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere, which allowed them to calculate how much water the planet has lost over time.\n\nThe findings are consistent with previous studies that suggested Mars was once a warm and wet planet, and they provide further evidence for the notion that life might have existed on Mars in the past. While the possibility of life on Mars is still a topic of debate, the new research suggests that the planet was once a more hospitable place for life to emerge and thrive.", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The film, starring Will Smith and Margot Robbie, is a caper about a veteran con man and his young apprentice. The movie's plot is described as ridiculous and absurd, with a lack of truth and no real revelation of the secret underworld it claims to expose. However, the film's charm lies in its portrayal of Will Smith's jaded charm and Margot Robbie's transformation from a clumsy thief to a skilled con artist.\n\nThe casting of the film was a highly publicized process, with several A-list actors considered for the lead roles. Ryan Gosling, Brad Pitt, and Ben Affleck were all considered for the male lead, while Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Kristen Stewart, Michelle Williams, Jessica Biel, Rose Byrne, and Olivia Munn were all considered for the female lead. Ultimately, Will Smith and Margot Robbie were cast in the roles, with Smith bringing his signature charm to the character of Nicky Spurgeon, a seasoned con artist.\n\nThe film's directors, Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, aimed to create a movie that would evoke the style of Alfred Hitchcock, with a mix of glamour and wit. They succeeded in creating a film that is both entertaining and visually appealing, with a cast of characters that are both likable and flawed. The film's tone is lighthearted and playful, with a focus on the con artists' schemes and the banter between the leads.\n\nWill Smith's performance in the film is notable, as he brings his signature charm and charisma to the role of Nicky Spurgeon. The film also features a strong supporting cast, including Adrian Martinez as a socially awkward con artist and BD Wong as a sinister businessman. Margot Robbie, who was a relatively new actress at the time of filming, brings a fresh energy to the role of Jess Barrett, Nicky's apprentice.\n\nOverall, \"Focus\" is a fun and entertaining film that is more about the characters and their relationships than about the plot.

The case revolves around the shape of the Kit Kat finger wafer, which Nestlé has been fighting to trademark in the European Union (EU) for over a decade.\n\nThe ECJ ruling sends the case back to the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) to review a 2012 decision that upheld Nestlé's trademark on the shape of the four-finger chocolate-covered wafer biscuit. Mondelez, the owner of the Cadbury brand, had objected to the trademark, arguing that the shape was not distinctive enough to be protected.\n\nThe ECJ found that Nestlé had failed to show that consumers in enough EU countries recognized the shape as distinctive, but also dismissed Mondelez's appeal against some of the grounds for a lower EU court ruling in 2016. The outcome leaves open the possibility that the EUIPO could preserve protection for Kit Kat's shape, but only if new evidence is presented to show that the shape is distinctive to people in more countries.\n\nThe trademark dispute has been closely followed by trademark lawyers, who see implications for brands operating across the EU single market. The case has also been mirrored by a dispute between the two multinationals in the British courts, where Nestlé objected to a trademark for the purple color used by Cadbury to wrap its Dairy Milk chocolate bars.\n\nThe Kit Kat shape trademark has been a contentious issue for over 15 years, with Nestlé applying for the trademark in 2002. The case has seen several twists and turns, including a lengthy court case in the UK that ended in a 16,000-word ruling that Kit Kat had \"no inherent distinctiveness.\" The dispute has also been linked to the Brexit debate, with some supporters of cutting ties with the EU suggesting that EU courts have failed to defend a much-loved British treat.\n\nThe outcome of the case is not yet clear, but it is likely to have significant implications for the chocolate industry and the way brands operate across the EU single market.", "answers": ["\"Four trapezoidal bars aligned on a rectangular base\" may not be instantly recognizable. Put that setup in chocolate form, however, and many people would be able to distinguish it as a KitKat.

Nestle, which makes KitKats, has been fighting Cadbury (and then Mondelez, which ultimately bought Cadbury) in the courts for more than a decade on this issue. The BBC notes that Nestle first applied for trademark protection for the candy's shape in 2002, and it was granted that protection four years later. Cadbury's pushback began in 2007, and Wednesday's decision by the European Court of Justice essentially tells the EU trademark office it now has to \"reconsider\" its original decision. What that means, however, is that if the EU Intellectual Property Office finds, based on more recent evidence, that the KitKat bar's shape is recognizable in enough countries, it can retain the trademark protection, per Reuters.

{"pred": "A new study suggests that dinosaurs, including the mighty Tyrannosaurus rex, may not have roared like they are often depicted in movies and popular culture. According to researchers, the sounds made by dinosaurs were likely more similar to those of birds, with a low, throaty whoosh of air, often referred to as \"closed-mouth vocalizations.\" This type of vocalization is characterized by a bird-like sound made by pushing air into an esophageal pouch rather than exhaling through an open beak.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Evolution, analyzed the vocalizations of 208 bird species and found that 52 of them use closed-mouth vocalization, which is often used for territorial or courtship displays. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have evolved independently at least 16 times in archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles.\n\nThe study's lead author, Tobias Riede, a physiology professor at Midwestern University, explained that the association with large body size is a matter of physics, as the inflation of an elastic cavity requires a certain level of lung pressure, which is more challenging for smaller body sizes.\n\nThe researchers believe that some dinosaurs, particularly those with large body sizes, may have made closed-mouthed vocalizations similar to those of birds today, perhaps during mating displays. However, no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like.\n\nIn a related study, sound designer Gary Rydstrom revealed that the iconic sounds of the 1993 film \"Jurassic Park\" were created using a variety of animal noises, including a tortoise, a horse, a goose, and a baby elephant. Rydstrom used these sounds to create the distinctive roars and hisses of the film's dinosaurs, including the T. rex and the velociraptors.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that the sounds of dinosaurs may have been more nuanced and varied than previously thought, and that they may have used closed-mouth vocalizations to communicate with each other. This new understanding of dinosaur vocalizations challenges the traditional image of dinosaurs as loud, roaring creatures and offers a more complex and fascinating glimpse into the lives of these ancient animals.\n\nIn addition, researchers have found that the capacity for closed-mouth vocalization was likely present in at least some extinct nonavian dinosaurs, and that this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, co-occurring with open-mouthed vocalizations. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of bird vocalizations and the sounds of their dinosaur ancestors", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

The university has raised $1.2 million from anonymous donors to repay the donation, which is the equivalent of the original gift. Chancellor Zeppos emphasized that the decision to remove the name is not about erasing history but about teaching it in a more nuanced way.\n\nThe move follows a national trend of universities and institutions re-evaluating their connections to the Confederacy and its symbols.

Statistical tools, particularly Bayesian statistics, have been used to refine and focus the search for the plane. Bayesian statisticians update their estimates of the probability of finding the plane in any given location based on new information, such as flight path, wind, ocean flow, and areas already searched.\n\nIn the case of Air France Flight 447, which disappeared in 2009, Bayesian statistics were used to locate the plane two years after the crash. A team of statisticians from Metron Inc. in Virginia, led by Colleen Keller, used Bayesian methods to assess the probability of the plane being found in different locations. They considered various scenarios, including mechanical failures and historical data from previous crashes, and updated their model as new information became available.\n\nThe team's probability map helped narrow down the search area, and a subsequent search found the plane's wreckage. However, the mystery of the crash was not fully solved until months later, when the team re-examined their assumptions and adapted their model to account for the possibility that the black box and voice recorder were not sending a signal.\n\nIn the case of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, Bayesian statistics are being used to inform the search efforts. However, the search area is vast, and the use of Bayesian methods is complicated by the new estimates of the plane's location and the mounting evidence that a deliberate act caused the disappearance. Some experts, such as Bradley Efron, a Stanford University statistician, question the effectiveness of Bayesian methods in this situation, while others, such as Tony O'Hagan, professor emeritus of probability and statistics at the University of Sheffield, argue that Bayesian techniques are well-suited to adapting to changing information.\n\nThe use of Bayesian statistics in search efforts has its challenges, including the need to quantify subjective judgment and account for uncertainties. However, the approach has been successful in the past, and it may be useful in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. Colleen Keller, the lead statistician on the Air France case, is skeptical that the plane will be found, citing the vast size of the search area and the likelihood that the wreckage may be undetectable.\n\nIn summary, Bayesian statistics have been used to locate missing planes in the past, and they may be useful in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

This event is a combination of a Blue Moon, a Supermoon, and a total lunar eclipse, making it a unique and spectacular sight.\n\n**What is a Blue Moon?**\nA Blue Moon occurs when there are two full moons in a single month, which happens approximately every 2.7 years. The second full moon in a month is called a Blue Moon.\n\n**What is a Supermoon?**\nA Supermoon is a full moon that occurs when the moon is at its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear 14% larger and 30% brighter than a regular full moon.\n\n**What is a Total Lunar Eclipse?**\nA total lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes between the sun and the moon, blocking the sun's light from reaching the moon. This causes the moon to take on a reddish hue, often referred to as a \"blood moon.\"\n\n**When and Where to See the Super Blue Blood Moon Total Lunar Eclipse**\nThe total lunar eclipse will be visible from eastern Asia, across the Pacific to western North America, on January 31, 2018.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.

{"pred": "**Car Suspended from Telephone Pole after Driver Reacts to GPS Directions**\n\nA bizarre incident occurred in Mendon on Wednesday evening when a Toyota Corolla became suspended from a telephone pole's guy wire after the driver, Nabila Altahan, reacted too quickly to a GPS system's instructions. According to police, Altahan was driving westbound on Route 4 when her GPS device suddenly directed her to turn around, as she had passed her intended destination. In a swift reaction, Altahan left the road, and her car ended up dangling from the telephone pole's support wire.\n\nFortunately, neither Altahan nor her passenger was injured in the incident. Witnesses, including a person at a nearby miniature golf course, reported seeing the driver jump out of the car as it was suspended from the pole. The Rutland City Fire Department and State Police responded to the scene, with State Police releasing a statement confirming the details of the incident.\n\nThis unusual accident serves as a reminder of the importance of carefully following GPS directions and not reacting impulsively to sudden changes in navigation.", "answers": ["Police in Vermont say a car ended up almost vertical when the driver swerved quickly in response to her GPS ordering her to \"turn around.\" The car was suspended almost vertically on guide wires attached to a utility pole (see a photo here) in Mendon on Wednesday night, reports the AP. Police say 30-year-old Nabila Altahan of Dorchester, Mass., was headed west on US Route 4 when she passed her intended destination and reacted quickly to the instructions, leaving the road at a significant enough speed to propel the vehicle up the wires. She wasn't injured. (This driver followed her GPS into a lake.)"], "all_classes": null, "length": 310}
