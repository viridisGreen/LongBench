In 2012, a judge had found Jack McCullough guilty of the murder, but Schmack, who was not the original prosecutor, found \"clear and convincing evidence\" that suggested McCullough was wrongly convicted. \n\nThe key factor in the decision was the discovery of phone records that supported McCullough's alibi, which stated that he was in Rockford, Illinois, at the time of the abduction, attempting to enlist in the US Air Force. The records, which were not available at the trial, showed that a collect call was made by the man to his parents at 6:57 pm from a phone booth in downtown Rockford, which is 40 miles northwest of the location of the abduction. \n\nThe abduction of Maria Ridulph took place on December 3, 1957, when she was approached by a man who introduced himself as \"Johnny\" and offered her piggyback rides.

This includes a decrease in the effectiveness of macrophages, a type of immune cell that helps to kill pathogens, and a decrease in the effectiveness of antimicrobial peptides, which are a crucial part of the body's defense against infection.\n\nThe study, conducted by Dr. Laura E.

The first study, conducted by the University of Toulouse's Young-Ho Eom, analyzed Wikipedia pages to determine which individuals are most referenced by other articles. The initial results were surprising, with Frank Sinatra as the most important person in the English-language world, and Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII in the second and third slots, respectively. However, when the study was expanded to 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, the results changed, with Adolf Hitler as the most important person. However, the point of the study was not to determine the most important individuals, but rather to examine the skew of attention on Wikipedia.\n\nThe second study, also by Eom, applied a similar method to determine the most influential thinkers in the world. The goal was to find the individual who is most connected to other important pages on Wikipedia. The result was a surprise: Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, also known as the \"Father of Taxonomy,\" was the most influential thinker in the world. Linnaeus' work in creating a scientific system of naming has led to his widespread reference on Wikipedia, making him the most connected individual in the study.\n\nHowever, a different study, published last year, used a different approach to determine the most influential scholar in history. The team, led by Jasleen Kaur, found that Karl Marx was the most influential scholar, based on the number of references to his work in other academic papers.\n\nThe Internet Archive is also using a similar method to preserve pages on the internet. The organization is using a technique called \"deep crawl\" to capture pages as they are created and preserve the pages that are referenced.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The suit claimed that the cheerleaders were underpaid, receiving only $150 per game and $100 for special events, without any compensation for practice sessions. The lawsuit argued that the cheerleaders made an average of $3.77 per hour, which is below the minimum wage when factoring in expenses such as hair, makeup, and transportation.\n\nThis is not an isolated incident, as several other NFL teams have been sued over their treatment of cheerleaders.

The disease has been on the rise in the US, with 50 cases reported in 24 states as of August 2016, compared to 21 cases in 2015. The cause of AFM is unknown, but it has been linked to viral infections such as enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and the mosquito-borne West Nile virus.\n\nAccording to the CDC, symptoms of AFM include limb weakness, facial droop, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and slurred speech. The exact trigger of AFM is often elusive, and there is no specific treatment. However, the best prevention is to wash your hands, stay up-to-date on vaccinations, and protect yourself from mosquitoes, which are linked to the mosquito-brown West Nile virus.\n\nIn 2014, a similar outbreak of AFM occurred, with 120 cases reported in 34 states, mostly affecting children aged 21 and under. The outbreak coincided with a national outbreak of severe respiratory disease caused by enterovirus D68 (EV-D68). However, the CDC did not detect traces of EV-D68 in the AFM specimens collected that year.\n\nThis year's cases have been reported in various states, including California, Massachusetts, Florida, Texas, Pennsylvania, and New York, as well as in the US. The cases have been reported in children and adults, with a majority of cases occurring in children. The cases have been reported in the months of July, August, and September, which is a time of year when enteroviruses are typically more active.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) may be the cause of AFM, but the CDC has yet to confirm this. The study of the virus may lead to prevention or treatment of the disease. An experiment conducted by researchers at the University of Colorado has shown that IVIG, a treatment for some other viral diseases, may be effective in preventing the disease.\n\nThe condition is extremely rare, and the exact cause is still unknown.

A coup led by a junta of captains, led by Amadou Sanago, took control of the country on March 22, overthrowing President Amadou Toumani Touré. The coup was a result of the government's mishandling of an insurgency in the north by Tuareg rebels. However, the coup has had a devastating effect, allowing the rebels to seize control of the entire northern half of the nation, including the key towns of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu.\n\nThe Tuareg rebels, who are divided into two groups - the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA) and Ansar Dine, which is linked to the North African branch of al-Qaeda, are making rapid advances in the north.

The rebels have taken control of the region, and residents have reported that Islamic law is being imposed, with bars and Western music being banned.\n\nThe international community has been responding to the crisis, with the African Union and West African nations imposing sanctions on the country.

{"pred": "Title: Eradicating Institutionalization: A Moral and Economic Imperative\n\nInstitutionalisation, a system where children are separated from their families and placed in residential institutions, has enabled the unjustifiable incarceration of 8 million children worldwide. This issue is particularly poignant at this time of year, as many of these children experience harsh conditions, such as poverty, malnutrition, and trauma, in institutions that are often well-intentioned but inadequate. According to the CEO of Lumos, an organization dedicated to eradicating institutionalization, the solution is not to improve the quality of these institutions, but to replace the system altogether.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization are dire, with children being less likely to be educated, physically or mentally well, and more likely to be abused or trafficked. The impact of not having a dedicated carer is particularly severe, causing stunting, developmental delays, and psychological trauma. Even well-resourced institutions have a profound effect on children, and the solution is to provide alternative solutions such as fostering, adoption, or family-based care.\n\nThe good news is that this is a solvable problem. According to Lumos, the institutionalization of children can be eradicated by 2050 through a combination of inclusive education and healthcare, support for vulnerable families, and a shift in the way we think about keeping families together. This is an economic as well as a moral imperative, as it is far more cost-effective to support a child in a family than in an institution.\n\nInternational donors play a significant role in this process, and the principles they promote and the issues they support can make a significant difference. The success of Lumos in countries such as Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, where the number of children in institutions has been significantly reduced, is a testament to the power of this approach. The social media campaign #Letstalklumos, launched by JK Rowling, aims to raise awareness and make this issue a global priority.\n\nIn a personal commitment, JK Rowling has taken on the role of president of Lumos for life, with the goal of eradicating institutionalization in our lifetime. This is a crucial time for making progress towards this goal, with the EU, the US, and the Global Alliance for Children setting a precedent for other donors. Everyone has a role to play in making this vision a reality, and it is an issue that can be solved in our lifetime.", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The memo also claims that the FBI and DOJ have omitted relevant information in their applications for surveillance, including the fact that the source of the information, Steele, was a paid advisor to the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign.\n\nAccording to the memo, the FBI and DOJ have used the FISA application to justify surveillance of Carter Page, a US citizen who served as an advisor to the Trump campaign. The memo claims that the application was based on a dossier compiled by Steele, which was paid for by the DNC and the Clinton campaign. However, the memo notes that the application did not disclose the fact that Steele was a paid advisor to the DNC and the Clinton campaign, and that he had a strong bias against Trump.\n\nThe memo also notes that the FBI and DOJ have repeatedly renewed the application for surveillance, even after Steele was terminated as a source for the FBI due to his improper disclosure of his relationship with the media. The memo claims that the FBI and DOJ have ignored or concealed Steele's motivations and the fact that his report was not corroborated.\n\nAdditionally, the memo notes that the FBI and DOJ have used the FISA application to justify the investigation of George Papadopoulos, a fellow Trump campaign advisor, but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos.\n\nIn a related news, the tweet from Twitter notes that users can add location information to their tweets, such as their city or precise location, and can also delete their tweet location history.\n\nOverall, the memo and the tweet suggest that the FBI and DOJ have used the FISA application to unfairly target individuals close to the Trump campaign, and that the application was based on a biased and unreliable source.

According to the memoir, Davis had two terminated pregnancies: one in 1994 due to a medically necessary ectopic pregnancy, and the other in 1996 due to a fetus with a severe brain abnormality.\n\nThe first pregnancy, in 1994, was a medically necessary abortion as the embryo was implanted in her fallopian tube, putting her own life in danger. Davis writes that she was \"heartbroken\" over the loss, which she believes was a \"technical abortion.\"\n\nThe second pregnancy, in 1996, was a fetus with a severe brain abnormality, including a condition where the brain was in complete separation on the right and left sides.

The trail has gained popularity after the success of the movie \"Wild,\" based on the memoir of Cheryl Strayed, who hiked the trail in 1995. According to the Pacific Crest Trail Association (PCTA), the number of inquiries about the trail has increased significantly, with a 300% increase in website traffic in the past year. The movie has also led to a significant increase in requests for permits for long-distance hikes on the trail.\n\nAs a result, the PCT is facing overcrowding issues, with over 4,000 long-distance hiking permits issued in 2016, and a maximum of 50 permits per day being taken in the mid-March to mid-May period. The PCTA has introduced a quota system to mitigate the impact of the increased number of hikers on the trail and the environment. However, the system is not perfect, and the PCT is still facing issues such as environmental damage, increased financial costs for essential services, and the potential for more helicopter rescues.\n\nThe PCT is a fragile ecosystem, and the increased number of hikers is putting pressure on the environment. The desert sections of the trail are particularly susceptible to damage, and the PCTA is considering putting in place additional management strategies, such as shelters, to mitigate the impact of the increased number of hikers. The cost of the hike is also a significant consideration, with a typical long-distance hike costing around $6,000.\n\nDespite the challenges, the PCT remains a popular destination for hikers, with many sections of the trail accessible for shorter hikes. The PCTA has also launched a campaign to promote responsible hiking practices, such as \"leave no trace\" and \"ambassadors of the trail,\" to encourage hikers to act as responsible stewards of the trail.\n\nThe PCT is a place of transformation and healing, with many hikers reporting that the experience has a profound impact on their personal growth and well-being. However, the popularity of the trail has also led to a more commercialized approach, with some hikers seeking to find spiritual or personal redemption through their hike. The PCT is a place of both personal growth and environmental challenge, and the increased number of hikers is putting the fragile ecosystem to the test.\n\nIn the past, the PCT was a relatively quiet and exclusive destination, with a maximum of 300 permits issued in 200", "answers": ["Hikers on the Pacific Crest Trail can expect to encounter harsh-but-beautiful landscapes, extreme fatigue, and—these days, at least—traffic. \"You can’t talk about the Pacific Crest Trail without mentioning the crowds,\" Pete Brook writes for Outside.

But don't take his word for it: The Pacific Crest Trail Association so far this year has issued more than 4,000 permits to people planning on tackling at least 500 miles of the trail. To put things in perspective: 300 people attempted to complete the entire PCT in 2006, according to the AP, with about 120 of those making it. In 2014, 1,000 people set off and about half completed the trail. More traffic means more stress on the land, more improperly disposed of poop, and more inexperienced hikers requiring rescue. So what's with the increase in traffic over the past few years? You can thank Cheryl Strayed and her enormously popular memoir-turned-major-motion-picture Wild. After the book came out in 2012, there was a small increase in interest in the trail, the PCTA's Jack Haskel told the AP in 2015. But after the movie, starring Reese Witherspoon, was released in 2014, interest in the PCT exploded. \"Millions are hearing about it now and are being inspired,\" Haskel said. Strayed, more or less unprepared for the journey, hiked 1,100 miles of the trail as a form of therapy as she grappled with personal demons. \"However for others that follow her strategy of deliberate ineptitude, things might not turn out so well,\" writes DontHikeLikeWild.org. \"Our advice to would-be hikers: Grow a spine first.

{"pred": "A new species of dinosaur, Caihong juji, has been discovered in China, which is believed to be the oldest animal with iridescent feathers. The dinosaur, which means \"rainbow with a big crest\" in Mandarin, is a small, bird-like creature that lived around 161 million years ago during the Jurassic period. The discovery was announced by scientists from the University of Texas at Austin, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and the Paleontological Museum of Liaoning.\n\nThe fossil, which was discovered by a farmer in Hebei Province, is exceptionally well-preserved, with many of its feathers still intact. The researchers used a combination of scanning electron microscopy and melanin analysis to determine the color of the dinosaur's feathers, which are similar to those of modern hummingbirds. The researchers found that the dinosaur's feathers were iridescent, with a rainbow-like display of colors, particularly on its head, neck, and tail.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong is significant because it provides new insights into the evolution of feathers and the diversity of colors in the ancient world. According to the researchers, the dinosaur's feathers were likely used for display purposes, such as attracting mates or intimidating rivals. The discovery also suggests that the ability to create iridescent colors in feathers was an early feature of the evolution of feathers, and that it was not limited to birds.\n\nThe researchers have also found that the dinosaur's plumage was a combination of dark and shiny feathers, with the dark feathers covering much of its body and the shiny feathers on its head, neck, and tail. The researchers have identified the presence of platelet-shaped melanosomes, which are the microscopic structures that create the iridescent colors in the feathers.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong has also shed new light on the diversity of feathers in the ancient world. The researchers have found that the dinosaur's feathers were asymmetrical, with the feathers on the left side of the tail being larger and more prominent than the ones on the right side. This is a key feature of modern birds, and the discovery of this trait in a dinosaur is significant.\n\nThe researchers have also found that the dinosaur's frond-like tail was likely used for display purposes, and that the asymmetrical feathers on the tail were likely used to steer the dinosaur in the air. The discovery of this trait in a dinosaur is significant, as it is a key feature of modern birds.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong has been published in the journal Nature Communications, and has been reviewed by several experts in the field", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

{"pred": "The city of Seattle has been experiencing a significant backlash from a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages, also known as the \"soda tax,\" which was implemented on January 1, 2018. The tax was intended to reduce sugar consumption, raise revenue for public projects, and provide subsidies for low-income families. However, the tax has been widely unpopular, with many residents and businesses expressing opposition. \n\nAccording to reports, the tax has led to drastic price increases in various products, such as a 34% decline in sales of affected beverages at Costco's nine Cook County locations. The company has also seen a 38% increase in sales of sweetened beverages in its stores outside of Cook County. Similar results were seen in other retailers, such as Fairplay Foods, which had a 47% decline in sweetened beverage sales. \n\nThe tax has also been a significant burden for small businesses, such as King's Bar & Grill, which relies heavily on soda for their business. The tax has been a major issue in the city, with some residents expressing frustration over the tax's implementation and the fact that it does not apply to sugar-heavy beverages like those sold at Starbucks. \n\nSimilar issues have been seen in other jurisdictions, such as Cook County in Illinois, which repealed a similar tax in December 2019. The repeal was a result of a strong public outcry and the fact that the tax had a significant impact on local businesses. \n\nThe tax has also been a subject of controversy, with some arguing that it is a form of social engineering and that it does not effectively discourage consumption of sugary drinks. The American Heart Association and other organizations have argued that the tax is a good way to reduce consumption of sugary drinks, which are linked to various health issues. However, the tax has been criticized for being poorly implemented and for not addressing the root causes of the problem. \n\nIn a similar move, a bill has been reintroduced in the state of Washington to impose a similar tax on sweetened beverages across the state. However, the bill is not expected to pass this year. \n\nThe tax has also been a subject of discussion in the media, with some arguing that it is a prime example of the \"frog in a boiling pot\" theory, where people become accustomed to gradual increases in taxes, but not sudden changes. The tax has been a win-win for the city's coffers, but a loss for local businesses and residents.", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

The report was titled \"The Humboldt 35: Why does Humboldt County have the highest rate of missing persons reports in the state?\" The report highlighted the high rate of missing persons in the county, with an average of 717 reports per 1,000 residents in 2000-2016, compared to a statewide average of 384. However, many of these reports are due to the county's permissive policy for reporting missing persons, and many of the individuals are not actually missing.\n\nAccording to the Journal's analysis, most of the missing adults in the county are either runaway juveniles or adults who have voluntarily gone missing. Many of these individuals are members of the local cannabis industry, which has a high turnover rate and often involves individuals who go out of communication for extended periods. The North Coast Journal found that many of the individuals on the list were not actually missing, and some were even active on social media.\n\nThe Journal also found that the county's high rate of missing persons is not a unique phenomenon. The county's seclusion and accessibility make it an ideal place to disappear. Many of the individuals on the list were not reported missing by the local authorities, and some were even reported missing by family members who were not in the county.

According to the suit, Arias was required to run the Xora app on her company-issued iPhone, which not only tracked her location during work hours but also during personal time. The app, which is designed to manage jobs and track employee productivity, has a \"clock in/out\" feature that does not stop the GPS monitoring, allowing the employer to see the employee's location at all times.\n\nThe plaintiff's attorney, Gail Glick, stated that the app was installed on the employees' phones without their consent, and even after Arias asked to be exempt from the monitoring, her manager, John Stubits, bragged about being able to track her movements and even her speed while driving. Stubits allegedly told Arias that she should tolerate the intrusion because she was being paid more than her previous employer, NetSpend.\n\nThe lawsuit, which also includes claims of retaliation, unfair business practices, and intentional interference with Arias' employment contract, seeks damages in excess of $500,000. The plaintiff's attorney stated that the company's actions were a \"really egregious situation\" and that they will be pursuing the case aggressively to get Arias the justice she deserves.\n\nThe app, managed by the company Xora, is designed to be a mobile tool for employees to manage their jobs and track their productivity.

The plaintiff's attorney stated that an employer can monitor employees at work for legitimate business purposes, but not without the employee's consent and not in a way that invades their personal privacy.\n\nIn a related note, the company's actions may have also interfered with Arias' ability to earn a livelihood, as her previous employer, NetSend, reportedly terminated her employment after the company's president and CEO, Robert Lisy, informed the company of Arias' alleged \"loyalty\" to Intermex.", "answers": ["Myrna Arias didn't like the GPS app on her phone that constantly tracked her, so she uninstalled it.

Arias started researching the app, then called Xora—its website touts the app's ability to let employers \"instantly see where their employees are and where they have been\"—and eventually she and some of her colleagues asked a trainer from the app company to clarify. Boss John Stubits then, per the suit, \"admitted that employees would be monitored while off duty and bragged that he knew how fast she was driving at specific moments.\" Arias says she has no problem being monitored while at work, but she complained to Stubits about being tracked in her free time; he was unsympathetic and said she should have no problem because of how much she was being paid by Intermex. \"Her manager made it clear that he was using the program to continuously monitor her, during company as well as personal time,\" the complaint states, noting that he told Arias she needed to keep her phone on at all times in case a customer called.

The protest aims to call attention to the truckers' dissatisfaction with various issues, including low wages, high fuel prices, and excessive regulations imposed by the Obama administration.\n\nThe group has a list of demands, including the arrest of politicians who allegedly disregarded the US Constitution, including President Obama, Secretary of State John Kerry, and Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham. The truckers are also seeking the impeachment of Obama, but according to the group's coordinator, Earl Conlon, they are not asking for impeachment, rather the arrest of those who have violated their oath of office.\n\nThe protest is not a simple matter of expressing dissatisfaction; the truckers are planning to use a \"grand jury\" to seek the arrest of politicians who have allegedly committed \"treason\" or have acted against the Constitution. The grand jury is a mechanism where a group of citizens, without the approval of the court, can seek to indict individuals. The truckers are also planning to present their demands to Congress, and if the politicians agree to sign an agreement, the protest will be canceled.\n\nHowever, the protest has been modified from the original plan, and the truckers are no longer planning to ask for the arrest of politicians. Instead, they are planning to use the protest as a way to \"penalize\" the politicians with a shutdown of the Capital Beltway, which will be achieved by blocking the traffic. The truckers are planning to keep the left lane open for emergency vehicles, but the rest of the lanes will be blocked, and only those with a \"T2SDA\" sticker will be allowed to pass.\n\nThe protest has gained momentum, with over 50,000 people liking the Facebook page and over 3,000 truckers RSVP-ed to the event. However, the protest has also been criticized for its potential impact on the traffic in the area. A similar protest in 2007, against illegal immigration and competition from Mexican truckers, did not cause significant disruptions to the traffic.\n\nThe truckers' protest is a stark", "answers": ["Protesting truckers are planning a shutdown of their own—on Washington's beltway.

One day, individuals may be on top, but the next, they are left with a tarnished reputation and a loss of power. 24/7 Wall St. has compiled a list of 50 well-known individuals who have experienced a significant loss in stature, including five individuals in various fields. \n\nFirst, let's consider the individuals who have lost power in the public sector. Anthony Scaramucci, the former White House Communications Director, was appointed in 2017 but was terminated after just two weeks due to his tumultuous behavior, including a profanity-laced interview and apparent breach of protocol. \n\nAnother individual who has lost power is Chris Christie, the former Governor of New Jersey. Christie's approval ratings were the lowest in the state's history, partly due to the Bridgegate scandal and his decision to let his family use a state-owned beach during a government shutdown. \n\nIn the law sector, former FBI Director James Comey was a significant figure in the 2016 presidential election. However, his decision to announce an investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server just before the election led to his termination by President Donald Trump. \n\nIn the business sector, Mark Fields, the former CEO of Ford Motor Company, was let go in 2017 due to his failure to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure as CEO, and his determination to take on Tesla in the electric and autonomous vehicle market was a significant factor in his downfall. \n\nLastly, let's consider the individuals who have lost power in the entertainment sector. Tiger Woods, a professional golter with 14 major wins, has been a significant figure in the golf world. However, his infidelity scandal in 2009 and subsequent arrest for a DUI incident have led to a significant loss in his reputation and ranking.

{"pred": "Summary of the News\n\nThe US is on the verge of a government shutdown after a standoff between the Republican-led House of Representatives and the Democratic-led Senate over a spending bill. The deadline for passing a new funding for federal agencies is Monday night, and the Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon. \n\nThe main point of contention is the Republican plan to delay the start of the health care law for one year and repeal the tax on medical devices. However, the Senate Democrats have vowed to reject any changes to the health care law, and President Obama has stated that he would veto such a bill. \n\nSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid has taken a firm stance, making it clear that the Democrats will not back up to the Republican demands. Reid has been the most ardent advocate for a hardline approach, and the party's leadership, senior White House officials, and the president are all on the same page. \n\nThe Washington region, which is the largest concentration of federal workers and contractors in the nation, is particularly at risk, with a potential loss of $200 million per day and over 700,000 jobs. The economic impact would be particularly severe, with the suspension of services such as social security, child-care subsidies, and clinical trials. \n\nThe Senate is expected to strip out the anti-Obama provisions from the bill, and the ball will be back in the Speaker of the House's court. If the House refuses to pass a clean stopgap measure, a partial government shutdown will occur for the first time since the Clinton era. \n\nThe potential shutdown has been averted in the past, but this year's situation is more complex, with not a single appropriations bill having passed in Congress. The ripple effects of a shutdown would be widespread, affecting not only the Washington region but also the national economy. \n\nThe Senate is not scheduled to reconvene until Monday afternoon, and the clock is ticking for the politicians to reach a compromise. The Senate will have the opportunity to table the amendments to delay the health care law and to repeal the medical device tax, which can be achieved with a 51-vote majority. However, the possibility of a shutdown is a near certainty at this point.", "answers": ["Washington is braced for the first government shutdown in 17 years, which will happen at midnight tonight unless lawmakers manage to break the deadlock over funding and hammer out a deal. Here's what to expect from a day of drama in DC: The House has passed legislation to delay ObamaCare for a year and repeal a tax on medical devices, so the measure will return to the Senate this afternoon, just hours before the shutdown is due to kick in. Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

The spacecraft, initially named Solar Probe Plus, is being renamed in honor of Eugene Parker, a prominent astrophysicist who discovered the existence of solar wind in the 1950s. This is the first time a NASA mission has been named for a living person. The Parker Solar Probe is designed to explore the sun's surface and its outer atmosphere, also known as the corona, in a region that has never been previously explored. The mission aims to solve two major puzzles: how the solar wind is accelerated, and why the corona is much hotter than the surface of the sun.\n\nThe spacecraft is equipped with a 4.5-inch thick carbon-composite solar shield to protect it from temperatures of up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit. The shield will keep the science instruments at a safe temperature, and the solar panels will retract and extend as the spacecraft moves around the sun to keep it at a safe temperature and to power the spacecraft. The Parker Solar Probe will make a total of 24 close flybys of the sun, some of which will bring it within 3.7 million miles of the solar surface, which is seven times closer than any other spacecraft has ever reached.\n\nThe mission will take seven years, with the spacecraft taking a series of flybys of the planet Venus to get its orbit closer to the sun. The spacecraft will be equipped with a thermal protection system and a solar array cooling system to protect it from the sun's intense heat and radiation. The mission will also provide a detailed understanding of the solar wind, which is a constant stream of particles from the sun that can impact Earth and cause space weather.\n\nThe Parker Solar Probe is a significant mission that will provide a wealth of information about the sun and its behavior.

This policy allows employees to take time off as they need during the first year after a child's birth or adoption, without having to worry about switching to state or disability pay. The policy is a significant step forward in the company's efforts to foster a \"freedom and responsibility\" culture, which allows employees to balance their work and family responsibilities.\n\nAccording to Tawni Cranz, Netflix's Chief Talent Officer, the policy is designed to support employees during the challenging times of their lives and allow them to return to work more dedicated and focused. The policy is a significant perk for employees, and it is a major step in the company's pursuit of a better work-life balance.\n\nThe policy is not limited to a fixed amount of time, allowing employees to take off as much time as they need. They can return to work on a full or part-time basis, and even take additional time off later in the year if needed. The company will keep paying employees normally, eliminating the hassle of having to switch to disability leave.\n\nThis policy is a significant departure from the traditional 3-6 months of leave that many companies offer. It is also notable for extending the benefits to both mothers and fathers, as well as to those who are receiving a child through adoption. The policy is a major step forward in the company's efforts to be a leader in the field of employee support and support for families.\n\nHowever, some experts have noted that unlimited time off policies can have their pitfalls, such as straining workplace relations and making it difficult for employees to manage their workload. However, Netflix has a long-standing policy of unlimited time off, which may mitigate some of these issues.\n\nIn related news, other companies such as Yahoo and Google have also extended their maternity and paternity leave policies to make them more competitive.

The study, published in the Astronomical Journal, estimates the planet's mass to be between five to ten times that of Earth and suggests that it may be an icy, rocky planet with a small envelope of gas. The researchers, led by Mike Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin, have not observed the planet directly but have inferred its existence from the motion of dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine is significant because it would bring the total number of planets in our solar system to nine, and would potentially reclassify Pluto as a dwarf planet. Pluto, which was once considered the ninth planet, was demoted in 2006 after the discovery of the larger dwarf planet Eris. However, the study's findings have been met with some skepticism, with NASA's director of planetary science, Jim Green, cautioning that there may be other explanations for the observed motion of the small objects in the outer solar system.\n\nDespite the controversy, the researchers are optimistic that Planet Nine will be discovered soon. Mike Brown, who is known as the \"Pluto killer\" due to his role in demoting Pluto, has been searching for the planet for years and believes that it will be discovered within a few years. The researchers have provided a \"treasure map\" of the planet's predicted path, which may help other astronomers to find it.\n\nIn related news, a new study by the University of Arizona has found that the planet's path is consistent with the idea of a massive perturber, or a planet that was ejected into a highly eccentric orbit. The study, which was published in the journal Nature, has been described as \"solid evidence\" for the existence of Planet Nine.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also renewed calls for Pluto to be reinstated as a planet. However, Mike Brown has argued that Pluto is not a planet and that the controversy over its status has been a distraction. He has said that the real issue is not whether Pluto is a planet or not, but rather whether it is a unique and interesting object that is worth studying.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, Mike Brown said that he has no regrets about his role in Pluto's demotion and that he is looking forward to the discovery of Planet Nine.

Michael \"Pluto Killer\" Brown and Konstantin Batygin haven't seen the supposed planet directly, but say they can infer the \"massive perturber\" exists by how the orbits of smaller bodies nearby are affected by its gravitational pull, the Post notes. What's interesting is that Brown and Batygin originally set out to disprove the existence of Planet Nine. \"We thought their idea was crazy,\" Brown says of the scientists who originally floated the idea of a large, hidden planet.

The press conference was described as \"unhinged\" and \"wild\" by CNN's Jake Tapper, with Trump attacking the media and labeling them \"dishonest\" and \"fake.\" The president also referred to the media as \"the opposition party\" and accused them of having \"a tremendous disservice\" to the American people.\n\nTrump defended his administration's actions, stating that he had \"inherited a mess\" from the previous administration and that his team was \"a fine-tuned machine.\" He also denied any wrongdoing in regards to his associates' ties to Russia, saying \"the leaks are real, but the news is fake.\" The president mentioned that he had nothing to do with Russia and that his administration was not involved in any wrongdoing.\n\nIn a surprising moment, Trump asked an African-American reporter, April Ryan, to set up a meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus, which she declined. He also asked a reporter if she was a \"friend\" of the CBC, and when she replied that she was a reporter, he asked her to set up the meeting.\n\nThe president mentioned that he had a \"substantial victory\" in the election, despite having fewer electoral college votes than several other presidents. He also stated that he had a \"very good\" talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin and that he was looking to get along with Russia.\n\nTrump's performance was described as \"bizarre theater\" by Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. The president's statements were often fact-checked in real-time, and he repeatedly dismissed the media's attempts to correct him.\n\nThe press conference was a departure from the \"buck stops here\" mantra of previous presidents, as Trump assigned blame to the media for his administration's woes. The event was described as a \"messy, fact-chached affair\" and was a throwback to the campaign-style press conferences that Trump used to hold during the election.\n\nThe Associated Press-GfK poll revealed that 87% of Trump's supporters believe the media is biased against him, and a Gallup survey showed that 39% of Americans approve of his job performance while 56% disapprove.\n\nIn other news, the president announced that his administration is making progress on repealing and replacing Obamacare, with a plan to submit a new plan in mid-March.

In 2005, meteorologist Robert Ricks, the forecast coordinator at the time, issued a series of bold and dire warnings that would ultimately prove to be the most accurate and effective in the NWS' history.\n\nThe most notable of these warnings, a \"SPECIAL MESSAGE\" issued on the eve of the storm, predicted that \"MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS.

He had a personal understanding of the potential impact, having witnessed the devastation of previous storms, such as Hurricane Betsy and Hurricane Camille, in the same area. The decision to issue such a warning was also a personal risk, as it was a bold and unprecedented move for the NWS at the time.\n\nThe impact of the storm was devastating, with widespread destruction and flooding that made the city of New Orleans uninhabitable for many years. The response to the disaster was also a heart-wrenching experience for Ricks and his colleagues, who had personal connections to the area and had friends and family who were affected by the disaster.\n\nThe issuance of the dire warning by the NWS has been recognized as a model for future emergency messaging, with the NWS encouraging the use of bold and direct language in emergency situations.

The incident, which involved pictures of the deceased comedian with altered images of his neck, was a result of a bullying campaign that drove Zelda, the daughter of Robin Williams, to stay away from the platform for an extended period. In response, Twitter has suspended several accounts and is planning to update its policies to better handle tragic situations like this one. \n\nHowever, this incident is not an isolated incident, and many users have reported similar experiences on the platform. Senior legal analyst Imani Gandy, from the reproductive health publication RH Reality Check, has reported that she faces constant abuse on Twitter due to her race, gender, and medical condition. Despite taking several measures to stop the harassment, such as ignoring the perpetrator and blocking multiple accounts, she has found that the abuse persists. \n\nGandy has also highlighted the issue of Twitter's inconsistent policies regarding harassment. In one instance, a tweet threatening to rape a woman was deemed not to be a violation of the platform's rules. This has led many to question the effectiveness of the platform's tools for dealing with harassment. \n\nTo address this issue, some experts have suggested that Twitter should take a page from a third-party software called \"Block Together,\" which allows users to block new accounts that send them direct replies and share their list of blocked accounts with friends. \n\nThe issue of harassment on social media is a complex one, and experts have suggested that the platform's commitment to free expression may be clouding its judgment on the issue. As a result, the character of the community on the platform is being compromised, and those who are most vulnerable to harassment are being left to deal with the consequences. \n\nIn a separate news, the Internet Archive has been receiving data from Alexa Internet since 1996, which is being used to create the Wayback Machine. This archive is a valuable resource for researchers and historians, providing a snapshot of the internet at various times over the years. \n\nOverall, the recent incidents on Twitter highlight the need for more robust policies and tools to deal with harassment on social media platforms.

{"pred": "Summary of Recent News: Rising Colorectal Cancer in Younger Individuals\n\nRecent studies have revealed a concerning trend of rising colorectal cancer in individuals under 50 years of age. According to a study published in the journal Cancer, one in seven colon and rectal cancers in the US are now diagnosed in people younger than 50, a number that is expected to rise to nearly one in four rectal tumors and one in ten colon cancers by 2030. The researchers, led by Dr. Samantha Hendren of the University of Michigan, analyzed data from the nationally representative Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute, covering 258,000 patients diagnosed with colorectal tumors between 1998 and 2011. The study found that 15% of the patients were younger than 50, and these individuals were more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer, but also tended to have better survival rates due to more aggressive treatment.\n\nThe researchers pointed to several factors that may contribute to the rising trend, including a lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis, as well as a lack of preventive screening for those with a family history of colorectal cancer. Dr. Joel Randolph Hecht, director of the gastrointestinal oncology program at the University of California Los Angeles, noted that many patients may ignore or be misdiagnosed with symptoms such as bleeding, changes in bowel habits, or pain, which are common signs of colon cancer.\n\nThe study also highlighted the importance of individualized treatment and the need for more research to determine the optimal age for screening. Dr. David Weinberg, chairman of medicine at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, noted that the goal of screening is to prevent disease, and it is unclear when screening should start. Dr. Andrew Chan, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, suggested that the increase in colon cancer among younger adults may be related to environmental factors, such as poor diet, obesity, and smoking.\n\nThe study's findings have implications for the medical community, with Dr. Hendren stating that the \"cancer community needs to prepare for the increasing number of very young colorectal cancer survivors who will need long-term support to cope with the physical and psychological consequences of their disease and treatments.\" The study's findings also suggest that more research is needed to determine the optimal age for screening and to develop more effective strategies for preventing and treating colorectal cancer in younger individuals.\n\nIn the meantime, experts recommend that individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer or other at-risk individuals", "answers": ["A new study says one in seven US colon cancer patients is younger than 50—raising questions about why more young people seem to be getting the disease and what can be done about it, reports HealthDay via the Philadelphia Inquirer. \"Colon cancer has traditionally been thought of as a disease of the elderly,\" says lead author Samantha Hendren. \"This study is really a wake-up call to the medical community that a relatively large number of colon cancers are occurring in people under 50.\" Using government data on almost 260,000 colon-cancer patients from 1998 to 2011, the study also says younger patients more often have advanced cancer and undergo surgery (72% compared to 63% of patients over 50). The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters. Hendren's team conducted the study after noticing a rise in colon cancer among young people, Medical Daily reports, but that spike remains unexplained. Physical inactivity, obesity, smoking, and \"an effect in our environment\" are all possible causes, a Harvard professor says.

A rock shelter, known as the Warratyi rock-shelter, was discovered by Giles Hamm, a consultant archaeologist and doctoral student at La Trobe University, along with Clifford Coulthard, an Aboriginal elder from the Adnyamathanha Traditional Lands Association. The site, which is approximately 550 kilometers north of Adelaide, has provided a treasure trove of artefacts and fossils that have been dated to be around 49,000 years ago.\n\nThe findings indicate that the first humans to inhabit the arid interior of Australia arrived earlier than previously thought, with some estimates suggesting they arrived as early as 49,000 years ago. This is a significant discovery, as it was previously believed that the first humans to inhabit the area arrived around 50,000 years ago. The findings also suggest that the development of key technologies, such as stone and bone tools, and the use of ochre, a pigment, were developed locally in Australia, rather than being brought from other populations.\n\nThe site has provided a range of artefacts, including burnt eggshells, sharpened stone and bone tools, and red ochre and gypsum pigments. The team has also found the remains of a giant bird and a giant wombat-like species, Diprotodon optatum, which suggests that the early humans were interacting with the megafauna of the region. The discovery of these remains in a well-dated and well-stratified context is significant, as it provides a clear indication of the presence of humans and their interactions with the environment in the region.\n\nThe discovery has been made using a combination of techniques, including optical dating of quartz grains and radiocarbon dating of the eggshells. The team has also used a combination of traditional and modern methods to analyze the artefacts and fossils, including use-wear and residue analysis.\n\nThe findings have significant implications for the study of Australian history and the development of the world's oldest continuously maintained civilization. The discovery has also provided a significant milestone in the debate over the extinction of megafauna in Australia, with some arguing that the discovery suggests that humans were the primary driver of the extinction, while others argue that the extinction was due to a combination of factors, including climate change.\n\nThe study has been published in the journal Nature and has been hailed as a significant discovery that has provided a new understanding of the history of the region.

Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial.

Andrew M. Calamari, a former director of the Securities and Exchange Commission, described the announcement as \"irregular\" and raised concerns about Musk's intent. The fact that Musk used social media to disclose the proposal without a simultaneous regulatory filing has raised suspicions.\n\nThe proposal, which would offer shareholders $420 per share, would make Tesla a private entity, but the deal is still unclear. The company's cash-flow negative status and the fact that it has not made a profit make it difficult to secure financing. Steven Kaplan, a professor of private equity, questioned how Musk would be able to raise the necessary funds.\n\nThe proposal has also raised concerns about the potential for manipulation of the stock price.

{"pred": "Summary of Advanced Technology and Elaboration of the Universe's Expansion\n\nA recent study by senior scientist Dan Hooper at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois and a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Chicago, has revived the concept of the three phases of technologically advanced civilizations proposed by astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1962. The three phases, also known as the three \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations, are:\n\n1. Type I: Harnessing all the resources of a planet\n2. Type II: Harnessing all the radiation of a star\n3. Type III: Harnessing all the resources of a galaxy\n\nAccording to Hooper, the universe's expansion at a rate accelerated by dark matter, will make it impossible to retrieve information from stars beyond the cosmic horizon after approximately 100 billion years. This means that for a civilization to meet other intelligent beings in distant galaxies, it will have an \"inevitability of the encroaching horizon\" and will have to capture and harvest stars from other galaxies before they become inaccessible.\n\nTo achieve this, Hooper proposes the use of a swarm of satellites, also known as \"Dyson spheres,\" to capture the energy of a star. This concept was initially proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960, and was also described by science fiction author Olaf Stapledon in his 1937 novel \"Star Maker.\" Stapledon described a swarm of solar-collecting satellites in a spherical shell, which would be a massive structure that would surround a star, harnessing its energy and peeling away the unproductive planets.\n\nThe concept of a swarm of satellites is further developed in the study, where it is proposed that the satellites would be made of millions of individual solar-collecting satellites, also known as \"statites,\" which would hover in space, collecting the energy of the star and beaming it back to the home planet. This would be a massive undertaking, requiring a significant amount of energy and resources, but would be a necessary step for a civilization to achieve the Type III level of technological advancement.\n\nThe study also notes that the presence of a swarm of satellites would be detectable as a significant increase in the amount of infrared radiation in the area, making it a potential method for detecting the presence of an advanced civilization. However, the technology for detecting such a signal is currently not available, and it is not known when it will be developed.\n\nIn the meantime, the study provides an interesting insight into", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out. Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies. So how to spot energy-grabbing aliens? Massive stars emanate certain light wavelengths, which will appear in galaxies' light signatures if stars are drained energy—that is, when humans have powerful enough instruments to detect it."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1741}

According to a study published in the journal Science, researchers have discovered that the Middle East African climate may have driven toolmaking advances and the development of trading networks among Homo sapiens or their close relatives around 320,000 years ago. The study, which was conducted in the Olorgesailie Basin in southern Kenya, found that the region's dramatic shifts in climate may have led to the development of more efficient tools and trading networks.\n\nThe researchers discovered that the Middle East African tools, which were previously dated to around 280,000 to 500,000 years ago, are now estimated to be around 320,000 years old. The study also found that the tools were made from obsidian, a rare rock that was sourced from a distance of 25 to 50 kilometers away, suggesting that there was a well-established trading network in the area. The researchers propose that the trading network was a result of the need for more efficient tools and resources in a region with unpredictable food sources.\n\nAnother study published in the journal Science has made a similar discovery, suggesting that the Middle East African region was more advanced in its technological and social development than previously thought. The study, which was conducted in the Olorgesailie Basin, found that the region's inhabitants were able to produce sophisticated stone tools, including blades and points, and were able to transport exotic materials such as glass and red ochre from a distance of 25 to 50 kilometers away.

Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit.

The use of a wireless system, such as the AirPods, is not an improvement, and it will require users to purchase additional accessories, such as a charging device, to use the pods. The AirPods also require an iCloud account to work, which is a requirement for many other Apple products.\n\nThe decision to remove the headphone jack has also been criticized for its impact on other devices that use the aux cable, such as the credit card dongle from Square, temperature sensors, and personal breathalyzers. These devices will have to be replaced with a proprietary Lightning connector, which will be an additional cost for consumers.\n\nIn conclusion, the decision to remove the 3.5mm aux cable input in the iPhone 7 has been met with ridicule and criticism from experts and consumers alike.

Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

The new system, which has been in the making for several months, reduces the number of sailing lanes from five to two, making the process more efficient and less congested.\n\nAccording to the airline, the new system is designed to make the sailing process more efficient and less stressful for passengers. The two lanes are designated as \"lane 1\" and \"lane 2,\" with \"lane 1\" being the \"blue\" lane for pre-boarding and the first group of passengers, and \"lane 2\" being the \"green\" lane for the remaining passengers.\n\nThe new system is divided into five groups, with each group being called to sail at a specific time. The order of the groups is based on the passenger's tier status, with the highest tier members being the first to sail. The groups are:\n\n1. Elite and other priority passengers in group 1 and 2 sail through lane 1.\n2. Customers in group 3, 4, and 5 sail through lane 2.\n3. Members of group 1 and 2 who are still arriving to the gate area will sail via the blue-colored lane 1.\n4. The remaining passengers in groups 3, 4, and 5 will be asked to remain seated until their turn is called.\n\nThe new system has been tested in select airports, such as Los Angeles International Airport, and is now being implemented across the nation. The airline has also introduced a mobile app that sends notifications to passengers when it is their turn to sail, making the process even more efficient.\n\nThis new simplified and improved sailing system is a result of the airline's efforts to improve the passenger experience and make the sailing process more efficient. The airline has been working on this new system for several months and has tested various options to ensure that the new system is the best solution for the airline and its passengers.\n\nIn related news, the airline has also introduced a joint business agreement (JBA) with Copa and Avianca, which will provide customers with more options for flights and improved service.

But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather.

Kieran was born with a rare condition called microtia, which is a congenial deformity that affects one in 100,000 children, where the external ear is underdeveloped. As a result, he was deaf and had small lobes where his ears should have been. However, thanks to several previous operations and a hearing aid, Kieran was able to hear, albeit with some difficulty.\n\nThe surgery, carried out by Neil Bulstrode, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, took six hours to complete. The process involved harvesting the cartilage from Kieran's ribs, carving and shaping it into the shape of his new ears, and then sewing them onto his head. The surgery is primarily cosmetic, but it has significant psychological benefits, as it boosts the patient's confidence and improves their quality of life.\n\nAccording to Neil Bulstrode, the surgery has a major impact on a child's confidence and can alter their entire trajectory in life. The surgery is not to improve hearing, but rather to give the child a normal appearance, which is essential for their well-being. The surgery is a significant improvement for children with microtia, and it has a high success rate, with most of the patients being satisfied with the results.\n\nKieran's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Sorkin, were overjoyed with the results, saying that they could not have wished for a better result. The parents of other children with similar conditions are also looking forward to the possibility of a similar surgery for their children. However, the study is still in its early stages, and for the foreseeable future, the traditional method of using cartilage from the ribs will be the primary method used for the surgery.\n\nIn the future, however, scientists at the University College London Institute for Child Health are working to develop a new method that uses stem cells from a child's own fat to create a new ear. This approach is less invasive and may be a more efficient method for the surgery. However, the study is still in its early stages, and more research is needed to determine the feasibility of this approach.\n\nKieran's reaction to his new ears was immediate, as he exclaimed \"Wow!\" and was delighted with the result.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

This change is a significant shift in the island's policy, where the drug has been associated with the country's culture and spirituality for decades.\n\nThe legislation also permits the use of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes, as well as for sacramental use by adherents of the Rastafarian spiritual movement.

This concept has been a cornerstone of Western law since the signing of the Magnolia Carta in 1215 and was further entrenched in the US Constitution. However, the Military Commissions Act (MCA) of 2006, passed by the last Congress, has significantly eroded this fundamental right by allowing the executive branch to declare individuals as \"enemy combatants\" and suspend their habeas corpus rights. This has been particularly evident in the case of Guantanamo, where many prisoners have been held for years without a fair trial. The MCA has been a significant threat to the foundation of the US legal and constitutional framework.\n\nIn a different area, the Nonhuman Rights Center has been pushing for the recognition of animal rights. In a breakthrough decision, a New York judge has ordered a hearing for two research chimpanates, Hercules and Leo, to determine whether they should be treated as legal persons. This is the first instance in US history where an animal has been granted a writ of habeas corpus, which typically allows human prisoners to contest their detention. The judge's decision is a significant step towards recognizing the rights of animals and may pave the way for other similar cases. The Nonhuman Rights Center is using this opportunity to argue that animals, such as elephants, whales, and dolphins, are autonomous beings and deserve the right to freedom.\n\nThe recognition of animal rights is a significant step forward, and the decision of the judge in New York is a crucial milestone in this journey. The implications of this decision are far-reaching, and it may lead to the reclassification of animals as persons with rights, rather than mere property. The decision also has the potential to be a significant precedent for other similar cases around the country.", "answers": ["The writ of habeas corpus lets prisoners appear in court to make their captors justify why they're being held.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo.

The company, a renowned manufacturer of musical instruments, was raided by federal marshals in September 2011, with agents seizing wood from two Nashville facilities and one in Memphis. The investigation is related to the Lacey Act, a 2008 amendment to an existing endangered species law that prohibits the import of plants and animals obtained through illegal means.\n\nAccording to the Environmental Investigation Agency, Gibson took knowingly sourced wood from Madagascar, a country with a ban on exports of ebony and rosewood. The company's CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz, denied any wrongdoing, stating that all of its suppliers have complied with US and Malagasy law. However, a court motion filed in June asserts that Gibson's Madagascar ebony was contraband, and that the company took steps to maintain a supply chain that was linked to illegal timber harvests.\n\nThe Lacey Act requires end users of endangered wood to ensure the legality of their entire supply chain, from the tree to the end user. Andrea Johnson, director of forest programs for the Environmental Investigation Agency, stated that Gibson was aware of the risks involved and made a conscious decision to source wood from Madagascar despite the ban. The company has presented documents to support its claim of compliance, but the government has yet to provide evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe enforcement of the Lacey Act has also affected other guitar manufacturers, with some dealers and manufacturers expressing concerns about the retroactive application of the law. The law requires owners of rare and vintage instruments to account for every wooden part of their instruments, which has led some dealers to be wary of traveling with their instruments. The government has attempted to create exemptions for vintage instruments, but these have been delayed and are not yet effective.\n\nIn a separate news, the Internet Archive, also known as the Wayback Machine, has been receiving donations of crawl data from Alexa Internet since 1996.

{"pred": "Summary of the Recent Discoveries on Mars\n\nRecent studies have revealed a wealth of information about the history of Mars, particularly with regards to its ancient oceans and the possibility of a one-time presence of life on the planet. According to NASA scientists, a massive ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars, making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold. The ocean, which was around 20 million kilometers of water and a mile deep in some areas, was a significant portion of the planet's surface, similar to the coverage of the Earth's ocean.\n\nThe study, which used infrared maps to analyze the Martian atmosphere, found that the water in the ocean was enriched with deuterium, a factor of 7 relative to Earth's ocean. This indicates that the planet had a significant amount of water in its past, which was lost over time due to the Martian atmosphere's ability to leak gas. The study suggests that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that would have reached a depth of 137 meters if it had covered the entire planet.\n\nHowever, the ocean was not the entire planet, and it is believed that the terrain of the planet at the time would have meant that the water would have pooled into a much deeper ocean in the northern hemisphere. This would have been a significant portion of the planet's surface, and would have provided a suitable environment for life to exist.\n\nThe study also revealed that the water in the ocean was not just a one-time occurrence, and that the planet was likely to be wet for a much longer time than previously thought. The study found that the water was present for at least 4.5 billion years ago, and that the planet was a warm and wet planet at that time.\n\nThe study has significant implications for the search for life on Mars, and suggests that the planet was a more promising place for life to exist in the past. The search for life on Mars is set to continue in 2018, when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the planet. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, and will provide further evidence of the planet's past and present.\n\nIn related news, a study published in the journal Science has revealed that the planet's water was once more extensive, with a study of the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere indicating that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the planet's surface. The study used a technique called spectroscopy to analyze the chemical composition of the atmosphere,", "answers": ["Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

However, when the situation turned dire, Jumaah sent a desperate text message to his professor, asking her to remove him from the doctoral program if he didn't return to Sweden within a week. Turner, however, was not about to give up on her student and his family.\n\nUpon receiving the message, Turner called Jumaah, who was frantic and hopeless. She realized the gravity of the situation and decided to take action. Turner approached the university's security team, and together with a security company, a rescue mission was arranged. A team of armed mercenaries was dispatched to Iraq, and Jumaah and his family were safely evacuated from the northern mountains to the safety of Erbil Airport.\n\nThe family was then reunited in Sweden, and Jumaah was able to complete his PhD. The family has made significant progress in paying back the university for the rescue operation.

On the one hand, the film showcases the slick and charming side of Smith, who plays the role of Nicky, a con artist, with his signature cool and charisma. The film's script, written by Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, has been described as a \"silly\" and \"absurd\" attempt at revealing the secrets of the underworld, but ultimately, it is a movie about the relationship between Nicky and Jess, the 24-year-old apprentice, and the charm of the two leads. \n\nThe film's casting was a significant aspect of its production, with several A-list actors and actresses being considered for the roles, including Ryan Gosling, Ben Affleck, and Jennifer Lawrence. However, the final mix of Will Smith and Margot Robbie was a deliberate choice by the directors to create a \"tasty\" and \"effortless\" movie that captures the essence of a 1950s Hitchcock film. \n\nThe film's success is largely due to the charm of its lead actors, particularly Will Smith, who has been playing the role of a stoic and serious character for too long. The film's director, Ficarra, has said that he and his partner, Requa, wanted to let Will be Will in the film, showcasing his signature cool and charm. \n\nThe film's dapper-con genre, which includes The Lady Eve and The Sting, is a classic theme of the film, and the film's success is largely due to its ability to provide a good time for the audience.

According to the study, published in the journal Evolution, the T. Rex may have made sounds similar to a bird's coo or ostrich's mumble, rather than a loud scream. The study, led by Tobias Riede and Chad Eliason, analyzed the vocal patterns of various bird and reptile species to determine the likelihood of dinosaurs making similar sounds. They found that many birds, particularly those with large body sizes, use a type of vocalization called \"closed-mouth vocalization,\" which is characterized by a low, throaty sound produced by a pouch in the neck. This type of vocalization is rare in small birds, but is common in larger species, such as pigeons and ostriches.\n\nThe study's findings are significant because it is thought that dinosaurs, as the ancestors of birds, may have used a similar system of vocalization. The researchers suggest that some dinosaurs may have made sounds similar to the bird's coo or ostrich's mumble, particularly during mating displays. However, the study also notes that the exact sounds that dinosaurs made are still a mystery, and may never be fully revealed due to the lack of fossil evidence.\n\nIn a related study, a sound designer who worked on the movie \"Jurassic Park\" revealed that the iconic sound of the T. Rex was created using a combination of sounds from various animals, including a baby elephant, a tortoise, and a goose. The designer, Gary Rydstrom, used a combination of exotic and mundane sounds to create the illusion of a ferocious dinosaur. The study highlights the fact that the sounds of dinosaurs are a mystery, and that scientists are using a variety of methods to try to determine what they sounded like.\n\nThe study also notes that the ability to produce sound with a closed mouth is a rare but common feature in birds, and is associated with large body size.

The study's findings are a significant departure from the popular imagination of dinosaurs as loud and ferocious, and instead paint a more nuanced picture of these ancient creatures.\n\nIn a separate study, a team of researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of archosaurs, a group that includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles, and found that the ability to produce sound with", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers.

As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

This change comes after a 14-year effort by the university to remove the name, which was a source of controversy due to its association with the Confederacy and the painful history of the Civil War. The change was announced by the university's Chancellor, Nicholas S. Zeppos, who stated that the name was a \"symbol and a reminder of racism, slavery, and a very, very bloody Civil War.\"\n\nThe university has been trying to change the name since 2002, but was initially blocked by the Tennessee Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, who had a $50,000 donation towards the building's construction and naming. However, the university was able to raise $1.2 million to repay the donation, which was the equivalent of the original gift, and was able to move forward with the change.\n\nThe decision to rename the dormitory has been praised by students and faculty, who argued that the name was a painful reminder of the university's history and was not an accurate representation of the values of the institution. The university has been making efforts to address diversity and inclusion, including adding a new diversity officer to the university's leadership team.\n\nThe decision to rename the dormitory has been compared to other efforts around the country to remove Confederate symbols and statues from public places. In the South, there have been calls to remove the name of Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general and slave trader, from a campus building at Middle Tennessee State University. However, the proposal has been met with a tougher hurdle after a new Tennessee law was passed, which makes it more difficult to remove historical markers.\n\nThe Southern Baptist Convention has also made a move to remove the display of the Confederate flag in its congregations. The decision to rename the dormitory has been a significant step towards the university's goal of becoming an institution that is inclusive and supportive of all students.\n\nIn an interview, Zeppos stated that the decision to remove the mention of the Confederacy from the building was a \"positive step for Vanderbilt\" and that the university is committed to moving forward and teaching accurate and inclusive history. The university has made a significant move towards a more diverse and inclusive environment, and the renaming of the dormitory is a significant step towards achieving that goal.\n\nThe decision to rename the dormitory has been met with both praise and criticism,", "answers": ["In an attempt to bury a relic of its past, Vanderbilt University announced Monday that it will pay more than $1 million to remove the word \"Confederate\" from one of its dorms, the Tennessean reports.

A state appeals court ruled the building could be renamed Memorial Hall only after Vanderbilt gave the United Daughters back their money—$1.2 million in today’s dollars. The university has the cash, thanks to a raft of anonymous contributors who wanted the tie to America’s painful past broken for good. \"It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,\" Zeppos told the Tennessean. \"And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.” Yet tampering with Confederate imagery remains controversial, and a new state law makes it harder to do so, the AP reports.

The longest-serving inmates on death row have been waiting for over 20 years for their appeals to be processed.\n\nThe slow pace of the death penalty in the US is due in part to the fact that most capital cases are handled by individual states, and the federal government's involvement in capital punishment has become increasingly rare. The 62 inmates on federal death row, including Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, are a rare exception.

The application of the death penalty in the US has been described as \"maverick\" in its application, with some states, such as Texas, Missouri, and Virginia, contributing the most to the number of prisoners on federal death row.

In a series of experiments, researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to record brain activity in individuals as they watched YouTube videos. The data was then used to develop a computer model that matched brain patterns to specific visual elements, such as colors, shapes, and movements. This model was able to reconstruct a dynamic visual experience, such as a movie, from brain activity.\n\nThe researchers, led by Professor Jack Gallant, used the model to piece together a YouTube video from the brain activity of their own colleagues, who had been watching the same set of movie trailers. The resulting video was a blurry, dream-like interpretation of the original, but it was a significant achievement in the field of neuroscience. This technology has the potential to be used to decode not just visual elements, but also more complex aspects of the brain, such as memories and thoughts.\n\nAccording to the researchers, this technology could one day be used to watch people's thoughts and memories, as well as to help people who are paralyzed to control their environment through the use of brain signals. However, the potential for using this technology in detective work or court cases is still uncertain, and the accuracy of the results would depend on the quality of the brain data and the complexity of the memories being read.\n\nThe researchers are now looking to improve the technology by developing more models to match the brain's many different modules, which would lead to a higher resolution and more accurate results. However, this would require significant computational resources and a large amount of data to analyze.\n\nThe study, published in the journal Current Biology, has shed new light on the human brain's ability to process visual information and has paved the way for further research into the neural basis of thought and memory.

The search for the plane has been ongoing for years, with various teams and methods employed to locate the wreckage. In this summary, we will explore the role of statistical techniques, particularly Bayesian inference, in the search for the missing plane.\n\nThe search for the Air France plane in 2011, which was missing for two years, was successfully resolved using mathematical techniques inspired by Thomas Bayes, a British Presbyterian minister. The team, led by Colleen Keller, used Bayesian statistics to assess the probability of different scenarios and provide a more focused search area. The team's approach allowed them to combine contradictory theories and update their model based on new information.\n\nA similar approach was employed in the search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. The team, which included experts from the French government and the US, used Bayesian statistics to refine the search area and estimate the probability of finding the plane in different locations. However, the search has been challenging due to the large area of the Indian Ocean and the fact that the plane may have been moved by ocean currents.\n\nThe team's approach was to apply Bayesian statistics to the available data, including the plane's flight path, ocean currents, and the results of previous searches. The team's model was initially based on the assumption that the plane was in the area of the last ping from the plane's on-board computer system. However, after re-examining the data, the team decided to change their model to account for the possibility that the plane was not emitting a signal from the plane's recorder. This change led to a new area of highest probability, which was then searched and found to be the location of the plane.\n\nThe success of the Air France search and the failure of the initial search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 have led some experts to question the effectiveness of Bayesian statistics in the search for the missing plane. However, others argue that the approach is essential in refining the search area and estimating the probability of finding the plane in different locations. The search for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is still ongoing, and the likelihood of finding the plane is uncertain.

Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations?

On January 31, a total lunar eclipse, also known as a \"Super Blue Moon,\" is visible from various parts of the world. This event is rare because the moon is not only a full moon, but also a \"supermoon,\" which means it appears larger and brighter due to its proximity to the Earth. Additionally, the moon is a \"blue moon,\" the second full moon in a single month, a phenomenon that occurs infrequently.\n\nThe total lunar eclipse is a rare occurrence, with the last similar event taking place in 1866. The event is also significant because the moon will pass through the Earth's shadow, causing the moon to appear in the southern part of the Earth's shadow, with the moon's southern part appearing much darker than the rest of the moon.\n\nThe event is visible in the western United States, eastern Asia, and the Pacific Ocean, with the Pacific Ocean being the best place to view the event. The total phase of the eclipse is 77 minutes, and the moon's appearance will change to a reddish hue due to the Earth's atmosphere.\n\nThe event is also notable because of the presence of a supermoon, which is a full moon that appears larger and brighter due to its proximity to the Earth.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald.

{"pred": "Summary of Global Obesity Trends\n\nA comprehensive study published in the medical journal Lancet reveals a staggering trend of rising obesity worldwide. The report, covering 188 countries from 1980 to 2013, shows that nearly 30% of the global population, or 2.1 billion people, are either obese or overweight. This has led to a significant increase in health issues such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and certain cancers.\n\nThe study found that the United States is the largest contributor to the global obesity population, with 13% of the total, despite having a relatively small population of 5%. Other countries with high obesity rates include Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Kuwait, where obesity rates are particularly high among women. In the US, the report notes that while the rate of increase in adult obesity has slowed in the past eight years, the country still has a significant problem, with 1.3 million adults being obese.\n\nThe study also highlights the fact that obesity is a global issue, affecting both rich and poor nations. The researchers found that the problem is most acute in the Middle East and North Africa, with over 50% of adult men and 65% of adult women being overweight or obese. The report notes that the main factors contributing to the rise of obesity are the increased availability of high-calorie, low-nutrition foods and the decrease in physical activity.\n\nThe study's findings are a significant departure from the past, where obesity was considered a problem mainly in rich nations. Today, the report notes that obesity is a pressing issue in all regions, with the exception of a few countries that have made some progress in reducing their rates. The researchers also noted that the problem is getting worse over time, with the number of overweight and obese individuals increasing from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 2013.\n\nThe World Health Organization has taken notice of the trend and has launched a study to find solutions to the problem. The report is expected to be released in 2015. The study's findings are a stark reminder of the need for a comprehensive approach to address the global obesity epidemic.\n\nKey statistics from the study:\n\n- 2.1 billion people worldwide are either obese or overweight, representing 30% of the global population.\n- The US is the largest contributor to the global obesity population, with 13% of the total.\n- The number of overweight and obese individuals has increased from 857 million in 1980 to 2.1 billion in 201", "answers": ["There are more obese or overweight people in the world today than there were people of any weight in 1935, the most comprehensive look at worldwide obesity in decades warns.

The country is currently in the final phase of its parliamentary elections, with the Muslim Brotherhood's party, Freedom and Justice, expected to gain a significant number of seats. The party, which has been the most consistent winner in the three rounds of voting, is estimated to have nearly 50% of the seats in the first two rounds and is expected to make significant gains in the final round. \n\nThe election is taking place at a time when the country is also witnessing a trial of the former president, who is being held accountable for the deaths of over 800 protesters during the 18-month-long popular uprising that led to his downfall. The trial has resumed after a two-month hiatus, with the prosecutor, Mustafa Suleiman, accusing Mubarak of imposing \"tyrannical rule\" and ensuring his son, Gamal, would succeed him. \n\nThe trial is a significant moment for the country, as it marks the first time an Egyptian president is being held accountable for the actions of the government. The trial is also a test of the ability of the new government to bring to justice those who were responsible for the violence during the uprising. \n\nThe election and the trial are taking place in a context of great uncertainty, with the military rulers of the country refusing to give up power until the end of June.
