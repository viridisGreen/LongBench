They have a presentation from the User Interface and Industrial Designer, which includes a prototype model with a remote controller. The prototype has features like a titanium material, a remote with a strawberry design, and some technical features like a titanium material, a remote with a jog wheel, and a system that can be used for functions like volume control, speech recognition, and a specific function for the remote. \n\nThen, they move to the evaluation of the prototype. They discussed the criteria for the evaluation, with a scale from 1 to 7. They had some discussions on the evaluation process, and the team's performance. They also considered the financial aspects, with the team aiming to stay within a budget of 50 million. They considered some options for the project, like using a hand dynamo or a battery, and made some decisions. \n\nThe team also discussed the possibility of a party to celebrate the project, and the meeting ends with the team members expressing that they are satisfied with the project and the process. \n\nI need to make sure that the answer includes the key elements: the prototype, the technical features, the evaluation process, the financial considerations, and the team's performance.

The UI's representative, Sammy, is part of the presentation. The UI concept involves the interface's features, like the use of buttons or a display. They considered using a push button or a liquid crystal display (LCD) but decided to use LCDs. However, they also considered the cost and the need for a more complex technology like LCDs. The UI representative mentioned that they need to reduce the cost, so they might use LCDs but with some features like LCDs. \n\nThen, the UI concept also includes the idea of a \"mill\" (maybe a typo, like \"min\" or \"mill\"?) with a large number of buttons, which the UI representative calls the \"mill\" (maybe \"mill\" is a typo for \"mill\" as a remote controller). They discussed the need for a more user-friendly design, with a minimal number of buttons and a display to show the functions. The UI concept was considered as a \"mill\" (maybe \"mill\" is a typo for \"min\" or \"mill\" as a concept) and the UI representative's concept was a \"mill\" (maybe \"mill\" is a typo for \"min\" or \"mill\" as a concept) with a few buttons and a display. \n\nThe UI also mentioned that the design should be as per the trend, like the \"mill\" (maybe \"mill\" is a typo for \"min\" or \"mill\" as a concept) with a look and feel of fruit and vegetables, making it more natural and using materials like rubber.

They looked into various aspects, like the look and feel of remote controllers, how people used them, and the features they wanted. \n\nThe findings were that users found the current designs \"very ugly\" and \"hard to learn.\" They also mentioned that users are \"very ugly\" and \"hard to learn.\" The users are more interested in features like \"LCD\" and \"L_C_D\" (maybe that's a typo, but it's probably referring to a feature like a visual feature) and \"zapping\" (which is a slang for changing channels) should be simple. The Marketing person also mentioned that users are more interested in the features, and the design is important. \n\nAnother part of the findings was that users, on average, only used 10% of the buttons, so they are not using the functions. The younger group (16-45) is more interested in features, but they are not a large group. The older group (65-45) is less interested in features but is more willing to spend. The Marketing person also mentioned that users would like a \"L_C_D\" (maybe a visual feature) and that the younger group would be more interested in features like LCD or speech recognition. \n\nSo, the findings are that the market is looking for a remote with a better design, features like zapping, and features like LCD.

The user wants a summary of the discussion related to the interface concept design from the transcript. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the transcript. The meeting involves several people, like the User Interface, Marketing, and others. The User Interface is presenting their concept. They talk about the buttons, like the power, mute, and channel buttons. They mention the quadrants for buttons and the menu button. They also discuss the design of the buttons, like being large and thin, and the use of different colors. \n\nThen, the User Interface mentions that some buttons have icons, like the volume and channel, but they are not clear. They also talk about the menu function, which is not present in the design. The User Interface and others discussed the need for a separate button for the menu, possibly using the scroll buttons. \n\nThe User Interface's design includes a menu button, and the scroll buttons for moving up and down. They also considered the shape of the remote, like a round shape and the use of a trigger. However, the User Interface's idea of a trigger was not considered suitable. \n\nThe User Interface's design is considered by the User Interface and others, and they also considered the costs. The User Interface's design is compared with the scroll buttons and the costs of different components. The User Interface's design is considered to be a better concept, but the costs are a concern. \n\nThe User Interface's design is summarized as having a large, thin, and trendy design with a menu function, separate buttons for functions, and the use of colors.

The User Interface and others present the prototype, which is a remote controller with a design inspired by fruits, like a strawberry. They mention the prototype's features, such as the titanium material, the strawberry shape, and the use of a titanium material. The system has features like a remote control, a titanium material, and some functions like LCD, buttons, and functions like volume control, speech recognition, and a specific function for the remote. \n\nThey also discussed the evaluation of the prototype, with a scale from 1 to 7, and the team's criteria. The team had to vote on the prototype's features, and they considered the design, materials, and functions. The team also considered the financial aspects, like the cost and the possibility of using a dynamo to avoid a battery. They had to make some cuts to the design to stay within the budget. The team's evaluation showed that the prototype is a good design, and they are planning a party to celebrate the project. \n\nSo, the main points are the prototype's design, the features, the presentation, the evaluation process, and the financial considerations. The team's discussion included the features, the materials, the functions, and the budget.

The User Interface Developer mentioned that users don't take the time to learn complicated functions. Then, the Project Manager and others discussed the need to simplify the functions. The Industrial Designer mentioned that the company can't afford lawsuits from unexpected functions. The Project Manager also mentioned that the board's guidelines required using plastic, which might mean sacrificing some functions. The User Interface Developer's presentation highlighted that users only use basic functions like switching on, changing channels, and adjusting the settings. The Project Manager then decided to focus on simpler functions and possibly use a combination of buttons and touch screen. The voice operation and touch screen were considered as options for additional functions. The Project Manager's goal was to meet the board's guidelines, ensure the design is safe, and make the functions as simple as possible. The Marketing team's data showed that the majority of users don't need the complicated functions, and the board's requirement for plastic and the need to avoid lawsuits also contributed to the need for a simpler design. The Project Manager's plan was to make the functions as simple as possible, with the possibility of adding more features like voice control or touch screen, but the core functions would be the most essential.

They found that the models for the HTC system had states based on the number of states per phone, which was three. For the Aurora, they looked at the pronunciation of digits and found that the number of states was more than the actual number of states needed. \n\nThey compared the models and found that the longer words had more states, leading to more training data. But for shorter words, the models had more states, leading to less training data.

PhD C mentions that they discussed some points, like the LDA filters, and the issues related to the feature vectors. But the main part for the Aurora back-processor is from PhD B. \n\nPharma B talks about improving the back-end performance. They mention that they trained the system with different models, like the HTK system, and found that the number of states and Gaussians per state matters. They compared the models for different words, like the Italian digits, and found that the models with more states (like 9 or 16) had issues because they had less data. They tried to adjust the models, like reducing the number of states for shorter words, to improve performance. \n\nAlso, they mentioned that the models were using a lot of Gaussians (like 6 per state) and that they might need to reduce this to make the models simpler. They are trying to create more specific models for each word, and they're using a script to calculate the durations of the models. The main idea is that the models with more states had issues due to insufficient data, and they are working on making the models more efficient and accurate. \n\nSo, the key points are: the Aurora back-processor is being improved by adjusting the number of states and Gaussians, models for different words are being optimized, and the focus is on making the models more efficient while ensuring they have enough data for training. \n\nI need to make sure I cover the key points from the transcript, like the number of states, the training data, and the models' performance.
