The study, which was conducted using methods borrowed from Google's PageRank algorithm, aimed to determine who the most important people are in the world. Initially, the researchers found that Frank Sinatra was the most important person, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. However, when they expanded the study to all 24 major language editions of Wikipedia, they found that Adolf Hitler was the most important, followed by Michael Jackson and Madonna.\n\nThe researchers used the PageRank algorithm, which measures the importance of a page based on the number of incoming links. However, this led to the unexpected result that Carl Linnaeus, a Swedish naturalist, was the most important person in the world. This was due to the fact that Linnaeus' life work was the creation of a system to classify organisms, and he is linked to many pages in the database, including those of various species that he named.\n\nThe researchers used a second method, CheiRank, which measures the number of outgoing links, and a third method, 2DRank, which combines the two. This led to a new result, with Frank Sinatra being the most important person in the world. However, the 2DRank method also revealed that Carl Linnaeus was the most influential thinker in the world, as he is the central figure in a large branching web of links in Wikipedia.\n\nThe study also found that the most influential thinker in the world was not the one who was most referenced in academic work, but rather the one who is most connected to other important people and things. This was also the case in a previous study, which found that Karl Marx was the most influential scholar in history. The study's findings suggest that the influence of a person can be measured in different ways, and that different methods can lead to different results. \n\nThe study also highlights the importance of the Internet Archive, which is working to preserve broken links on the web by archiving pages and the pages that they refer to.

In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

{"pred": "Title: Ending the Harmful Practice of Child Institutionalization: A Global Effort to Eradicate a Cruel Reality\n\nIn a world where 8 million children are separated from their families and locked away in institutions, a movement is gaining momentum to eradicate this harm. The charity, Lumos, founded by J.K. Rowling, aims to bring an end to the unjustifiable incarceration of children and replace it with a world where families and communities care for those in need. \n\nLumos was born from a powerful image of a caged child, which sparked a sense of shame and a determination to change. The organization's mission is to shed light on the lives of these children, who are often not orphans, but rather children with families that can care for them, or those who are being taken away due to poverty, disability, or discrimination. The shocking truth is that many of these children have parents that can provide care, but due to lack of local education and health facilities, or because of poverty, they are forced to leave their families.\n\nThe effects of institutionalization are devastating. Research has shown that these children are more likely to be abused, trafficked, and experience developmental delays, stunting, and psychological trauma. The impact is particularly severe for infants, who are left without the love and attention of a dedicated carer. Damage is done from the start, and it is lasting, with these children returning to the world with their chances of a happy, healthy life severely impaired.\n\nHowever, the good news is that this is an entirely solvable problem. Based on the successes already achieved in several countries, such as Moldova, the Czech Republic, and Bulgaria, Lumos estimates that the practice of child institutionalization can be eradicated globally by 2050. The solution is not to provide more resources to existing institutions, but rather to invest in inclusive education and health, foster care, and adoption, and to replace the culture of institutionalization with one that prioritizes keeping families together.\n\nInternational donors play a vital role in this effort, and the issues they choose to fund and the principles they promote can greatly influence what support is available to children and families. Ending the practice of keeping children in institutions makes excellent economic sense, as it is more cost-effective to support a child in a family rather than in an institution. The model works, as shown in the successes of the countries where Lumos has worked, and it is possible that by 2020, the Czech Republic will be without any more children in institutions.\n\nThe #Let", "answers": ["JK Rowling makes the case today that millions of kids around the world are living in appalling conditions—the stuff of Grimms' fairytales—in institutions that are supposed to be caring for them.

The big challenge is providing support for often-poor families who think they have no choice but to place their child in such an institution. If a child's biological family isn't up to the task, then foster families can step in. But Rowling argues that institutions are absolutely the wrong answer.

She wants to raise awareness and donations with campaigns like this one. \"I recently committed to becoming president of Lumos for life,\" writes Rowling. \"It is my dream that, within my lifetime, the very concept of taking a child away from its family and locking it away will seem to belong to a cruel, fictional world.\" Click for her full column."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1530}

The site, which was once one of the biggest and most impressive in Britain, has been excavated by a team led by Dr. Jim Leary of the University of Reading. The team has discovered a 4,300-year-old house, which is one of the best-preserved from the period ever found in the UK. The house, built around 2,400 BC, was likely used for gatherings and feasts, as evidenced by the presence of pig bones and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit. The team has also found beautifully worked flint arrowheads, decorated pottery, and a Roman brooch.\n\nThe Marden Henge is part of a larger complex, with a vast space of 15 hectares, and was once enclosed by a three-meter-high ramparts. The purpose of the Marden Henge is believed to be a status symbol, showing off the wealth and power of its creators. The team is working to uncover the layers of the monument, and the site is being welcomed to the public for an open day, which will include tours, activities, and displays of the finds.\n\nOn the other hand, a 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child, has been discovered at Wilsford Henge.

The dinosaur, which lived 161 million years ago, is a crow-sized, bird-like dinosaur with iridescent feathers, particularly on its head, neck, and chest. The team of scientists, led by paleontologist Dongyu Hu, found that the dinosaur's feathers were iridescent, with melanosomes that were long, flat, and organized into sheets, similar to those in the iridescent throat feathers of hummingbirds.\n\nCaihong juji was a two-legged predator with a Velociraptor-like skull and sharp teeth, and it likely hunted small mammals and lizards. The team suggests that the iridescent feathers may have served as a social or sexual cue, like those of modern peacock tails. The dinosaur's body was bird-like, with the types of feathers required for flight, but its head was crested, which more closely resembles that of a Velociraptor.\n\nThe team used scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging to analyze the nanostructures in the dinosaur's feathers, and found that they were similar to those in the iridescent feathers of hummingbirds. The nanostructures were long, flat, and organized into sheets, and were likely used to create iridescent colors. The team suggests that Caihong may have had a rainbow-like display of iridescent feathers, but this is not the only feature that set the dinosaur apart. Its asymmetrical feathers, which were used for flight, are now the oldest known adaptation of this feature.\n\nCaihong may not be the only iridescent dinosaur, as a similar discovery, Microraptor, was made in 2012 and lived 40 million years after Caihong. The team suggests that there may be two different ways of creating iridescent color in raptor dinosaurs before the origin of birds. Caihong's iridescent feathers may have been used for display purposes, but the team suggests that the dinosaur may have had other display features, such as its funky bone crest and asymmetrical tail.\n\nThe discovery of Caihong has sparked new questions about the evolution of iridescent feathers and the functions of the dinosaur's display features. The team suggests that the iridescent feathers may have played a role in the dinosaur's social or sexual life, but this is not the only theory. The discovery has also sparked new questions about the evolution of the asymmetrical feathers, which are now the oldest known adaptation of this feature", "answers": ["Scientists are now saying there may have been \"a more colorful Jurassic World than we previously imagined,\" thanks to the recent discovery of a fossil in China's Hebei province. Reuters reports that a closer look at the \"exquisitely preserved,\" almost completely intact fossil of a crow-like dinosaur that lived about 161 million years ago revealed that Caihong juji had luminous, brilliantly hued feathers that closely resembled those of hummingbirds. The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

The news was confirmed after she had previously denied it on ABC's Good Morning America in February.\n\nAs a result of the pregnancy, Snooki's plans for her new reality show, \"The Jersey Shore: Reunion 2.0,\" may be put on hold.

The show's production team has not commented on the news, but insiders suggest that Snooki's pregnancy may have been a factor in the delays.\n\nThe news has sparked debate about the potential risks of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) that may affect the baby. FAS is a condition that can occur when a child is exposed to excessive alcohol during pregnancy, and it can cause a range of physical and behavioral problems. The risk of FAS increases with the amount of alcohol consumed and the frequency of exposure. In the United States, about 10% of pregnant women have consumed alcohol in the last month, and 20% to 30% have done so at some point during the pregnancy.\n\nFAS is a preventable condition, and medical authorities recommend no alcohol during pregnancy or while trying to become pregnant. The condition is permanent, but treatment can improve outcomes. Interventions may include parent-child interaction therapy, efforts to modify child behavior, and possibly medications. The lifetime cost of an individual with FAS was estimated to be two million USD in 2002.\n\nIn a related news, Snooki has a well-documented history of having a good time, and in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, she admitted that she may occasionally overdo it.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown. If there is a shutdown, it won't be an abrupt halt to government, but more \"like a spending freeze that will gradually spread through the government like ice forming in water,\" Quartz explains. Federal employees, 800,000 of whom will be sent home without pay, will be the first affected, and the shutdown will also affect scientific research, trade negotiations, and the federal programs that guarantee home loans and provide capital to business. Air traffic controllers will still be at work, however, and agencies that deal with national security and law enforcement are exempt from the shutdown. A shutdown of a few days might not do too much damage, but experts warn that the national economy will take a serious hit if it is prolonged. In Washington, DC, however, even a brief shutdown will cost the district an estimated $200 million a day—and affect basic services like trash collection. \"This is serious,\" the director of George Mason University’s Center for Regional Analysis tells the Washington Post. \"The national economy may not notice a shutdown much unless it lasts three or four weeks.

Neiman Marcus has not publicly given any estimate of how many credit card numbers were stolen, or how many customers were affected, but it noted that it does not collect PINs in its stores.\n\nIn a similar breach at Target, the company informed its customers about the attack within a few days of learning about it for the first time, pushed also by inquiries from a journalist specializing in computer security, Brian Krebs. The Target breach was caused by a type of malware, similar to a computer virus, placed in a store's point-of-affect systems, and the data breach was caused by a type of malware, similar to a computer virus, placed in a store's point-of-sale systems. The malware was triggered by a \"hook\" and started to suck up information on transactions in the memory of the cash register system or the server that controls it.\n\nA 17-page report from a computer firm hired to look into the Target breach provides new insight into the holiday hacking that endangered data for more than 100 million customers. The report, from the firm iSight, was filed to the U.S. Secret Service and obtained by NBC News. It details the type of software used in the massive hack, how it was effective and mentions regions known to have the software coding prowess to pull off this kind of digital heist.

The tactic used during the Target holiday hackers is \"new to eCrime,\" and \"covertly subverts network controls and common forensic tactics to conceal all data transfers.\" The report concludes that since this style of POS hacking can net big rewards for the cyber crooks with little risk, cardholders can expect more of this type of breach. \n\nThe U.S. Secret Service and the two breaches are being investigated by a growing group of state", "answers": ["It looks like the hackers that hit Target had lots of other, well, targets.

The 13-year-old lion, known for its distinctive black mane, was a beloved member of the King Fisher pride and had been a star attraction for tourists. The incident sparked an outcry in Kenya, with many questioning the decision to shoot the lion instead of using tranquilizers.\n\nMohawk had been on the loose for several days, having escaped from the park due to a territorial dispute with another lion. It was surrounded by a crowd of people, who took pictures and threw rocks, before the lion was shot. The Kenya Wildlife Service stated that the decision to shoot the lion was made as a last resort, as the situation was too dangerous for the public.\n\nThe incident has sparked debate over the balance between protecting humans and conserving lions, a vulnerable species.

He has been involved in the discovery of over 30 of these objects, including the dwarf planet Eris, which led to the redefinition of the term \"planet\" in 2006. Eris, a dwarf planet more massive than Pluto, was one of the many objects that forced the International Astronomical Union to reconsider the definition of a planet, ultimately leading to Pluto being demoted from its position as the 7th planet to the 9th.\n\nHowever, Mike Brown and his colleague, Konstantin Batygin, have been working on a new discovery, a giant icy planet, known as \"Planet Nine\" or \"Planet 9,\" which is thought to be about 5-10 times the mass of Earth and 2-4 times the size of the Earth. The discovery is based on the motion of recently discovered dwarf planets and other small objects in the outer solar system, which are influenced by the gravity of a hidden planet. The existence of Planet Nine is not a direct observation, but rather a mathematical inference, and it is thought to be about 20 times farther from the Sun than the 8th planet, Neptune.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has sparked debate, with some arguing that it could be the new 9th planet, and others questioning the evidence. The International Astronomical Union has a set of criteria for determining a planet, including the need to \"clear the neighborhood\" around its orbital zone, which Planet Nine may fulfill. Mike Brown and his team are working to provide a treasure map for the discovery of Planet Nine, and the search is ongoing.\n\nThe discovery of Planet Nine has also sparked debate over the reclassification of Pluto, which was demoted in 2006. Some argue that Pluto should be reinstated as a planet, but Mike Brown argues that it is not a planet and that the reclassification was necessary to help the understanding of the solar system. He believes that the controversy will eventually die down, and people will understand that Pluto is not a planet, but rather a unique object in the outer solar system.", "answers": ["Pluto is gonna be PO'd.

The study, conducted by Dr. Sripal Bangalore and his team, found that individuals with coronary heart disease who experienced large fluctuations in weight over a period of 4.7 years were at a higher risk of heart attack, stroke, and death compared to those with smaller weight changes.\n\nThe study, which involved 9,509 men and women with coronary heart disease, found that the risk of heart attack was 117 percent higher, the risk of stroke was 136 percent higher, and the risk of death was 124 percent higher for those with the greatest weight changes compared to those with the smallest weight changes. The researchers also found a link between weight changes and increased risk of new-onset diabetes.\n\nThe study suggests that individuals with coronary heart disease should be concerned about weight fluctuation, and that maintaining a stable weight is crucial to preventing the deadly consequences of \"yo-yo\" dieting. The researchers recommend that individuals with coronary heart disease should focus on maintaining a stable weight, rather than trying to lose weight repeatedly.\n\nCoronary artery disease, the underlying condition that led to the study, is the most common form of heart disease among men and women in the United States, and it can be caused by atherosclerosis, the buildup of plaque in the coronary arteries. This can lead to atherosclerosis, which can block the blood supply to the heart, resulting in angina or heart attack.\n\nThe study's findings are consistent with previous research on the dangers of \"yo-yo\" dieting, and suggest that this may be a critical factor in the health consequences of this condition. The researchers suggest that further investigation is needed to understand the causes of increased risk with body weight fluctuations and to develop strategies to help Americans keep weight off, rather than having it go up and down.\n\nIn a related note, a new study on coronary artery disease suggests that the underlying condition can be caused by a combination of factors, including cholesterol-containing deposits in the arteries and inflammation.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

{"pred": "A recent study by astrophysicist Dan Hooper has revived the work of Nikolai Kardashev, a Russian astrophysicist who in 1962 proposed a model for measuring the energy consumption of technologically advanced societies. Kardashev's model consists of three phases, or \"types\" of technologically advanced civilizations: \n\n- Type I: A technologically advanced society that harnesses all the resources of a planet.\n- Type II: A society that harnesses all the radiation of a star.\n- Type III: A society that harnesses all the resources of a galaxy.\n\nKardashev's model has been used to describe the energy consumption of various societies, with Kardashev himself proposing that the energy consumption of a society could be measured by the amount of energy it harnesses from its parent star. However, the new study by Dan Hooper suggests that the only way a technologically advanced society could prevent the ever-expanding universe from leaving them alone in the vastness of space is to harness energy from distant stars.\n\nThe study suggests that any sufficiently advanced civilization that is determined to maximize its ability to utilize energy will expand throughout the universe, attempting to secure as many stars as possible before they become permanently inaccessible due to the inevitability of the expanding universe. The energy from these stars could be harnessed by using a swarm of satellites, known as \"Dyson spheres,\" which would be a swarm of millions of solar-powered satellites that could permanently hover around a star, beaming energy back to a nearby planet.\n\nThis concept of \"Dyson spheres\" was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyosn in 1960, and has since been used in various forms in science fiction. The concept is based on the idea that a technologically advanced society could re-engineer their solar systems, perhaps dismantling planets to form a shell of satellites around their star to capture its energy. This would be a Type II of Kardashev's model, and would be a significant step towards becoming a Type III, which would be a society that harnesses all the resources of a galaxy.\n\nThe study suggests that any advanced civilization would be able to harvest energy from stars by using a swarm of satellites, and that this could be detected by observing the unusual light signatures from the galaxies. This could be a way to detect and track the energy-harving abilities of a technologically advanced society, and could potentially lead to the discovery of alien civilizations.", "answers": ["Watch out for stars moving across galaxies or losing power—it could be aliens gathering energy before the lights go out.

Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

The Nevada Parole Board will consider his release, and the decision is expected to be made on Thursday. \n\nSimpson's release would be a result of his good behavior behind bars, as he has been a model prisoner since 2013. He has been serving a nine to 33-year sentence for the 2007 robbery of two memorabilia collectors at the Palace Station hotel-casino in Las Vegas. The convictions included kidnapping, armed robbery, and assault with a deadly weapon. Simpson claimed he was trying to recover memorabilia stolen from him, but the convictions have been a result of his actions.\n\nSimpson's past is marred by the 1994 murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. He was acquitted of the murders in 1995, but was found liable for the deaths in a civil suit in 1997 and ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages. The Brown and Goldman families have not received much of the judgment, with Goldman's sister stating that the family has collected less than 1 percent of the judgment.\n\nSimpson's net worth has decreased significantly since his heyday in the 1990s.

The law also permits the cultivation of up to five plants on any premises and allows Rastafarians to use marijuana for religious purposes.\n\nThe law paves the way for a Jamaican medical cannabis industry, with a licensing agency to regulate the cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical, scientific, and therapeutic purposes. Local scientists have a history of developing marijuana-derived products, such as \"Canasol,\" which helps relieve pressure in the eyes of glaucoma patients. The law also allows tourists who are prescribed medical marijuana abroad to apply for permits to buy small amounts of Jamaican \"ganja.\"\n\nThe Jamaican government has made it clear that the law will not lead to a \"free-for-all\" in the growing, transporting, or exporting of marijuana, and that the security forces will continue to enforce Jamaican law in line with international treaty obligations.

The overwhelming majority of the men were sold into captivity by Northern Alliance and Pakistani warlords for bounties, and only 10 out of nearly 800 have been charged with any crime.

Borch, who was in a state of panic, managed to drown the racod in a puddle, but not before it had sunk its teeth into her thumb and caused her to bleed and cry.\n\nBorch's experience was a harrowing one, and she has since received six shots, including the rabies vaccine, immunoglobulin, and tetanus injections. She is slated to receive her last injection on Saturday. The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (MDCP) confirmed that the racod tested positive for rabies, and Borch's experience has left her shaken.\n\nA second incident of rabid racod was reported in Topsham, where a Wiscasset man was bitten on both hands. This incident highlights the fact that rabies can affect not just animals, but also humans, and that it is a fatal disease if left untreated. The MDCP has confirmed that 20 animals, including racods, red foxes, and skunks, have tested positive for rabies in 2017, a significant decrease compared to the 64 animals in 2016.\n\nRabies is a deadly disease that affects the brain and spinal cord, and can be fatal if left untreated. The MDCP has confirmed that rabies in animals is common in most parts of the country, including Maine, and that it is essential to be aware of the risks and take precautions. Rachel Borch's harrowing experience has left her shaken, but it has also raised awareness about the importance of being cautious around animals and the risks of rabies.", "answers": ["Rachel Borch was out for a jog in the woods near her home in Hope, Maine, when a \"ferocious-looking\" attacker with beady eyes and tiny teeth made a beeline for her, reports the Camden Herald.

The team used infrared maps of the Martian atmosphere to determine that the water was lost over time, and the remaining deuterium-rich water in the polar reservoirs indicates that the early Mars had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep.\n\nThe scientists found that the water was lost due to the Martian atmosphere being too thin, allowing the water to evaporate and the planet to lose its insulation, leading to the ocean's gradual disappearance. The remaining 13% of the ocean is now locked up in the Martian polar caps. The team's findings suggest that the ancient Martian world was a more hospitable environment for life, with long-standing bodies of water, lakes, and possibly seas.\n\nThe evidence is based on the analysis of the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the vapor, showing that the hydrogen in water comes in two varieties: standard hydrogen and the \"heavy\" hydrogen, or deuterium.

Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

The script is vague, and the business of Nicky's operation is unclear. The movie's emotional core, the relationship between Nicky and Jess, lacks impact, and Will Smith's idea of playing romance is to act cool, which means he withdraws and is serious. The movie's success is due in part to the chemistry between the leads, particularly Will Smith and Margot Robbie, who are both charming and charismatic.\n\nThe movie's success is also due to the fact that it's a Will Smith movie that dares to be small. The dapper-con genre, which includes \"The Lady Eve\" and \"The Sting\", demands of its audience only a readiness to fall for the flimflam, as Nicky's marks do.

This behavior, also known as \"closed-mouth vocalizations,\" is characterized by the emission of low-frequency sounds through the skin in the neck area while the beak is kept closed.\n\nThe researchers used a statistical approach to analyze the distribution of this vocal ability among birds and other reptilian groups, and found that 52 out of 208 bird species use closed-mouth vocalization. This behavior has evolved at least 16 times in the group of archosaurs, which includes birds, dinosaurs, and crocodiles. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have been limited to sexually selected vocal displays, and that it could have been used by some extinct nonavian dinosaurs.\n\nThe study also found that the inflation of an elastic cavity, which is necessary for closed-mouth vocalizations, is a size-dependent challenge, and that only animals with a relatively large body size (about the size of a dove or larger) use this behavior. This suggests that some dinosaurs, which had large body sizes, may have made closed-mouth vocalizations in a manner similar to birds today, perhaps during mating displays. However, no direct fossil evidence exists to reveal what dinosaurs sounded like.\n\nThe researchers suggest that the study offers clues to what nonavian dinosaurs sounded like, and that it makes for a very different picture of the Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds. The study's findings also suggest that closed-mouth vocalizations may have evolved independently in different groups of animals, and that it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays.\n\nIn a related study, researchers have found that some birds, such as those with a closed beak, use closed-mouth vocalizations to emit low-frequency sounds. This behavior is often seen in birds with a large body sizes, such as those with a body size of a dove or larger. The researchers suggest that this behavior may have evolved independently in different groups of birds and that it can be used in various forms of communication, such as mating displays.\n\nIn a study on the sounds of Jurassic Park, the sound designer, Gary Rydstrom, revealed that the sounds of the movie were created using a variety of sounds from different animals, such as tortoise", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world.

The recorded brain activity was then fed into a computer to create a \"movie reconstruction algorithm,\" which matched neural activity to what was taking place in the video.\n\nThe researchers were able to create a continuous, if abstract, reconstruction of the actual videos, which is a significant achievement. This is a departure from previous research, which has been able to reconstruct static photos and images from brain activity, but not dynamic visual experiences. The team's goal is to understand how the brain processes dynamic visual experiences, which will pave the way for the ability to see what's going on in the mind without visual stimulation, such as dreams and thoughts.\n\nThe technology has the potential to be used in a number of fields, including the ability to broadcast imagery, the scenes that play out inside our minds independent from vision. This could be used to help those who are paralyzed and can only communicate through their brain activity. The technology could also be used to help people who have Lou Gehrig's disease and other paralyzing conditions to control their environment by imagining sequences of movements.\n\nThe researchers are also exploring the possibility of decoding things in the brain that are \"movie-like\" but have no real-world analog, such as dreams.

The committee's final report, released on Tuesday, found that the State Department and the Obama administration knew from the beginning that the attack was a terrorist attack, not a result of a protest or an anti-Islamic video. The report also found that the administration's public statements, led by then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were false and were intended to deflect blame.\n\nThe report, which was released in two versions, one from the Republicans and one from the Democrats, was the result of a two-and-a-half-year investigation and $7 million in taxpayer funds. The Republicans' version accused Hillary Clinton and other officials of not adequately heeding concerns about growing extremism in Libya and of falsely blaming the violence on an anti-Muslim video. The Democrats' rebuttal to the report found that the committee's findings did not alter the public's understanding of the attack, and that the facts remain the same, including the fact that there was no stand-down order, no effort to politicize the right's talking points, and no evidence of gun trading.\n\nThe report also revealed that the State Department and the Obama administration had a 9/11-14-day timeline of public and private statements, with the public statements downplaying the attack and the private statements acknowledging the attack was a terrorist one. The report also found that the State Department's security was not adequately prepared for the attack, and that the officials were more concerned with the image of the State Department and the country, rather than the actual security of the diplomats.\n\nThe release of the report has been met with controversy, with the Democrats accusing the Republicans of trying to politicize the attack and the Republicans accusing the Democrats of not taking the attack seriously.

How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report.

According to a new study, 2.1 billion people worldwide are either overweight or obese, which is a staggering 30% of the global population. This is a significant increase from 1980, where 857 million people were overweight or obese, a 28% increase in adults and a 47% increase in children. The study, published in the medical journal Lancet, covered 188 countries and found that the United States is the leading country in the world for obesity, with 13% of the global obese population, despite having only 5% of the world's population.\n\nThe study found that the Middle East and North Africa, Central America, and the Pacific and Caribbean islands have the highest obesity rates, with some countries such as Bahrain, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia showing a significant increase in obesity rates. The availability of cheap, fatty, sugary, and salty \"junk food\" and the rise of sedentary lifestyles have been identified as major factors contributing to the problem. The World Health Organization has launched a program to study the causes and solutions to this problem, and a report is due in early 2015.\n\nThe study also found that the problem is not limited to developed countries, but is also prevalent in developing countries, with two-thirds of the obese population residing in developing countries. The researchers noted that the problem is not just a matter of cosmetic appearance, but rather a serious risk factor for heart disease, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, and certain cancers, with over 3.4 million adults dying from chronic complications of weight each year.
