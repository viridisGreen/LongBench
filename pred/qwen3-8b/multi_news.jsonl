The protesters were at City Hall, waiting to be evicted by the mayor's deadline. The police didn't evict them, and the city was planning to build fencing there. Some protesters were leaving, but others stayed. There's mention of their activities like serving soup, chanting, and the city's plans for the plaza. Also, there's a mention of a couple who might move to Washington, and some people's opinions on the city's handling of the situation. There's also a note about Twitter interactions with the mayor and a crowd watching the event.\n\nPassage 2 talks about Occupy L.A. The LAPD declared an unlawful assembly and ordered protesters to disperse by midnight. They had a tense standoff, but no arrests yet. The police didn't go into the encampment. There's mention of a federal injunction request and the size of the encampment. The mayor gave a deadline, but police allowed the camp to stay until daybreak. The article also notes that Philadelphia's deadline passed without incident, with some protesters leaving but many staying.\n\nPassage 3 is more detailed about the LA situation. The police in riot gear approached but didn't clear the encampment. Four arrests happened, and there was a confrontation with protesters. The encampment was large, with many homeless people. The mayor wanted them to move to other areas, and there was a call for support from various groups. The police were seen as more restrained compared to other cities, and some protesters praised them.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. The main points are the two cities, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, both dealing with Occupy protests. In Philly, the deadline passed without eviction, police were calm, and some protesters left. In LA, there was a tense standoff, some arrests, but police didn't clear the camp. Both cities had different approaches, with LA being more accommodating but still facing challenges. Also, the protesters' activities, their reasons (economic inequality, corporate greed), and the city's plans for the plaza. Mention the federal injunction request in LA.

At around 5am, police told protesters over a loudspeaker that they didn't intend to clear the park, the LA Times reports. Police do, however, intend to clear protesters out of the street, and several people who refused to move out of an intersection have already been arrested. \"We definitely need to get morning traffic in,\" a police commander explained. Everything also seems calm at Occupy Philadelphia, where protesters defied a 5pm Sunday deadline to disperse.

He wrote a letter to the Russian Orthodox Church Patriarch before his death, expressing guilt over the deaths caused by his invention. He had previously denied responsibility, blaming other countries' policies. The letter mentions his spiritual pain and questions if he's morally responsible. There's mention of his daughter and a priest possibly helping write the letter.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply—one that very may well have calmed his fears. Says the rep, \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it.\" But the BBC notes that it's not clear whether every word came from Kalashnikov: Izvestia reports that his daughter believes a priest helped him write the letter."], "all_classes": null, "length": 1377}

The police shot him, but there was a delay in paramedics reaching Hernandez because the terminal wasn't declared safe. The TSA administrator was testifying about the incident. There's mention of coordination issues between police and fire departments, leading to delays in medical treatment. The officer was eventually taken to the hospital but didn't survive. There's also a discussion about first aid training for police and the lack of compliance with training, which might have contributed to the situation.

Morsi is under investigation for espionage and murder, which his supporters say are politically motivated. The military's allowing the meeting might indicate willingness to work towards a political solution. Ashton met with Morsi via helicopter, and he was in good condition. She also met with ElBaradei, who acknowledged Morsi's failure but wanted the Muslim Brotherhood involved. The meeting seemed to calm tensions after violence.

The conviction was overturned after a new trial was granted by Judge William Brady. The main reasons given were that there was \"clear and convincing evidence\" that McCullough was wrongly convicted. The evidence included phone records showing he was in Rockford at the time of the abduction, which contradicted the original timeline. The case had been unsolved for 58 years, and a tip from McCullough's half-sister led to the re-examination. The prosecutor, Richard Schmack, reviewed 4,500 pages of documents and found the evidence supporting McCullough's alibi. The family of the victim, including Charles Ridulph, was upset, as they believed McCullough was guilty. McCullough had always claimed he was in Rockford trying to enlist in the Air Force, and the phone records confirmed that. The case was complicated by the lack of physical evidence and the passage of time, which made it hard to prosecute.\n\nPassage 2 seems to be a follow-up or a different angle.

The prosecutor, Richard Schmack, conducted a six-month review and found that McCullough couldn't have committed the crime. The original trial in 2012 had convicted McCullough, but Schmack's findings led to the overturning. The victim's family, especially Charles Ridulph, still believes McCullough is guilty and wants a special prosecutor. The case had national attention in the 1950s, and the discovery of the body 144 days later.

McCullough, who lived in the same neighborhood as the kidnapped girl, says he was 40 miles away at an Air Force recruiting center at the time of the kidnapping. It's an alibi that passed a polygraph test in 1957 and made it impossible for him to be the culprit based on the FBI's original timeline for the kidnapping. That timeline was later changed by police, and Schmack says documents—including phone and Air Force records—supporting McCullough's alibi were wrongly not allowed at his trial.

Also, the bacteria adhere better to human cells, making infections more severe. The study mentions that e-cigarette vapor also has similar effects but to a lesser extent.

Researchers found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria exposed to the smoke became more aggressive and far more difficult to kill, they explain at Eureka Alert. It's almost as if the smoke sets off an alarm that causes the bacteria to strengthen its defenses, explains the Union-Tribune of San Diego. Scientists made the discovery by exposing immune cells to two different batches of MRSA, one normal and one treated with cigarette smoke extract. The bigger the dose of smoke, the bigger the effect, notes Medical Daily. \"We already know that smoking cigarettes harms human respiratory and immune cells, and now we've shown that, on the flipside, smoke can also stress out invasive bacteria and make them more aggressive,\" says lead author Laura Crotty Alexander of UC San Diego. It's a double-whammy: Smokers already have weakened immune systems that make them more susceptible to infectious diseases, and the smoke they inhale seems to make invading pathogens even more dangerous. In this study, the smoke helped MRSA survive longer and kill more mice with pneumonia.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about a study by Young-Ho Eom from the University of Toulouse analyzing Wikipedia articles to determine the most important people. They used methods similar to Google's PageRank algorithm. The initial result was Frank Sinatra as the most important, followed by Michael Jackson and Pope Pius XII. But when considering all 24 language editions, Adolf Hitler came first, with Michael Jackson second and Madonna third. The study aimed to check if Wikipedia's attention is skewed by gender, time, or location. They found that most important figures are from Western countries after the 17th century and are male. The study also mentions that Linnaeus was the top in the initial analysis due to his classification system leading to many links. They used a combination of PageRank and CheiRank (2DRank) to get the final rankings.\n\nPassage 2 is about the Internet Archive's efforts to archive web pages to prevent broken links. They crawl sites to save pages and their references, so when original pages change or disappear, the archived versions are preserved. The goal is to fix broken links by replacing them with archived versions.\n\nPassage 3 is another study by Eom's team, this time focusing on the most influential thinker. They used Wikipedia's link structure to determine who's at the center of the most extensive network. The result was Carl Linnaeus, the father of taxonomy, beating out everyone else, including Jesus and Hitler. The reason given is that scientific names in every Wikipedia edition link back to Linnaeus. This study is different from the previous one, which focused on importance, while this one focused on influence through interconnected links.

Second place goes to Michael Jackson, and third to Pope Pius XII. When factoring in all 24 language editions of the online encyclopedia, the team found that Adolf Hitler ranked the most important person, while Michael Jackson was again second and Madonna third, reports the Guardian. \"Our analysis shows that most important historical figures across Wikipedia language editions are born in western countries after the 17th century, and are male,\" the authors write. The researchers combined two algorithms to reach these conclusions. First, Google's PageRank algorithm, which determines a page's importance based on how many other pages link to it. In using PageRank on Wikipedia, the most important person in the world was 18th-century Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus, likely because the pages of organism after organism link back to the \"father of taxonomy.\" So the researchers added an algorithm called CheiRank, which determines importance based on the number of outgoing links, the thought being that an important person would himself be connected to other important people, things, and events. Using the two together—an approach they dubbed 2DRank—no one beat out Frank Sinatra on English pages or Adolf Hitler across all language versions.

The key points are that the policy allows Samsung and partners to listen to users' conversations via voice recognition, which has drawn comparisons to George Orwell's 1984. The policy mentions that data is sent to third parties, and users can turn off the feature, but even then, some data collection continues. There's a mention of encryption and the ability to disconnect from Wi-Fi. The internet of things (IoT) is highlighted as a concern here.\n\nPassage 2 is more detailed about Samsung's SmartTV features and their privacy practices. It talks about personalized recommendations based on user data, voice recognition that sends data to third-party services like Nuance, gesture controls, facial recognition, fitness services, kids' content, and third-party data sharing. It also mentions that users can disable some features but not all, and Samsung collects usage data even if they disable certain features. There's a note about not collecting data from children under 13 without consent.\n\nPassage 3 is about Microsoft's Xbox One and the new Kinect peripheral. The main issue is that the Xbox One is always listening, even when turned off, to respond quickly to voice commands. This has raised privacy concerns, comparing it to 1984. The Kinect can recognize individual voices and even heartbeat, which is seen as creepy. There's a mention of past privacy issues with Kinect and Microsoft's response, including a statement that they don't plan to spy on users. The update from Microsoft clarifies that the Kinect listens for specific cues like \"Xbox On\" and emphasizes privacy protections.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary.

The Bills' cheerleaders, the Jills, have class-action status in a wage suit, and Savino wants the NFL to set uniform rules for cheerleaders' pay and protections.\n\nPassage 2 confirms the settlement, mentioning it was approved in August 2015. The $325k covers two seasons, with $2,500 per season worked, plus $400 per photo shoot. Krystal's suit claimed $150/game and $100 for events, no pay for practices or rehearsals. The attorney, Patricia Pierce, argued the hourly rate was below minimum wage, even after expenses. The Jets aren't the first; other teams like Bengals, Buccaneers, Raiders, and Bills have faced similar lawsuits.

His symptoms started with vomiting and fever, leading to paralysis. The CDC reported 32 cases in the US by July 2016, up from 7 in 2015. The cause is unknown, but there's a link to enteroviruses like EV-D68. Some doctors think EV-D68 might be involved, but the CDC hasn't confirmed it. There's no specific treatment, and most cases are in children, though adults can be affected too. The article mentions other cases like McKenzie Anderson and Laura Carson, who also had AFM. The CDC is monitoring the situation and advising on hygiene.\n\nPassage 2 from the CDC states that in 2016, there were 50 cases of AFM in 24 states, double the 2015 numbers. AFM affects the spinal cord and is linked to viruses like polio, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and West Nile. Symptoms include limb weakness, breathing issues, and no specific treatment. The 2014 outbreak coincided with EV-D68, but the CDC didn't find it in AFM specimens. Prevention includes handwashing and avoiding sick people.\n\nPassage 3 details Carter Roberts' case again, mentioning the CDC's report of 50 cases in 2016. It links AFM to enteroviruses, especially EV-D68, which is circulating again. Doctors warn it could be similar to the 2014 outbreak. Prevention advice includes hygiene and vaccinations. Carter's current condition is limited movement, but his mother is hopeful with speech therapy.\n\nPassage 4 from TODAY reports 50 AFM cases in 2016, double 2015. Symptoms include limb weakness, facial droop, breathing issues. Prevention is handwashing, vaccines, and avoiding mosquitoes. The 2014 peak had 120 cases, mostly children.

Another bloodstain pattern expert notes that more research could be done to see whether cleaning a body or preparing it for burial might account for the inconsistent staining, though he notes that the stains do appear to have come from flowing blood, meaning a heart that was beating at the time the stains were made.

Then it mentions North Korea's chemical weapons capability, up to 4,500 metric tons annually. There's a mention of Kim Jong-nam's death in Malaysia, with North Korea denying responsibility and blaming Malaysia. The North Korean government claims responsibility lies with Malaysia and threatens them, while the Malaysian authorities accuse North Korea. The two women involved are being held, but their families say they were forced. \n\nPassage 2 details the use of VX nerve agent in Kim Jong-nam's assassination. Malaysia's police chief confirms VX was found on his face and eyes. North Korea denies involvement, accuses Malaysia of fabricating evidence. The attack happened at Kuala Lumpur airport, with the women applying VX. The agent is highly toxic, and experts suggest a small amount was used. There's a mention of decontamination efforts and the persistence of VX. Kim Jong-nam was a critic of North Korea, and his death has caused a diplomatic crisis. North Korea's chemical weapons stockpile is discussed, and they haven't signed the Chemical Weapons Convention.\n\nPassage 3 confirms the use of VX, with police stating it was detected. The two women were allegedly coated with VX and applied it to Kim's face. He died after convulsions. The airport wasn't decontaminated initially, raising safety concerns. Toxicologists are puzzled about the women not being affected. North Korea's chemical capabilities are reiterated, and there's mention of possible sharing with other countries. Malaysia is seeking more people, including embassy staff. The case has strained Malaysia-North Korea relations.\n\nNow, I need to combine these points into a concise summary.

The FBI and DOJ opposed its release, but the President approved it. The memo details the FISA process during the 2016 election, pointing out issues with the DOJ and FBI's handling of the surveillance. It mentions the Steele dossier, which was funded by the DNC and Clinton campaign, and how the application didn't disclose the political origins of the dossier. There's also mention of Steele's unauthorized media contacts and his termination as an FBI source.

It mentions the cast, director, and the challenges of remaking a classic. The review points out that the film tries to blend old-school gothic horror with modern CGI, but the result is a mix that doesn't work well. The makeup is criticized as campy, and the acting, especially by Benicio Del Toro, is seen as lacking the emotional depth of the original. The film's attempt to be a bridge between old and new horror is considered a failure, leading to a mediocrity.\n\nPassage 2 is another review of \"The Wolfman,\" which is more critical. It calls the film visually beautiful but ultimately disappointing. The director, Joe Johnston, is criticized for not utilizing the potential of the film. Benicio Del Toro's performance is mocked as unconvincing, and the special effects are seen as dated. The film is compared unfavorably to the original, with the remake being called a \"toothless exercise in the obvious.\" The review also mentions other movies like \"Valentine's Day\" and \"Ajami\" as part of the news, but they seem to be separate topics. The main focus here is on \"The Wolfman\" again, highlighting its flaws and the director's missteps.\n\nPassage 3 is a more lighthearted take on \"The Wolfman.\" It acknowledges that while the film isn't great, it's enjoyable in a campy, old-school way. The review mentions the cast's efforts and the film's homage to the original, even though it's gory and silly. It's compared to other horror films and notes that the remake isn't a bad effort, just a fun, if goofy, movie. The transformation scenes are praised, and the film is seen as a faithful updating of the Universal horror tropes, even if it's not perfect.\n\nNow, I need to combine these three reviews into a coherent summary.

The article mentions that the pay is justified because managing the company during low oil prices is harder, and Dudley has made progress in cleaning up the Gulf of Mexico disaster and improving safety. It also compares his pay to Shell's CEO, noting that Shell's pay decreased, while Dudley's remained flat with more pension and deferred bonuses.\n\nPassage 2 is from The Wall Street Journal. It says a shareholder advisory group criticized BP's decision to give maximum bonuses to top directors, especially since the company had a poor performance. The CEO's bonus increased to $4.2 million, and the CFO also got 100% of his bonus. The company lost $5.2 billion, cut 7,000 jobs, and reduced spending. Glass Lewis recommended against the pay, but Dudley's pay was approved by 86% of investors. The shareholders will vote again in April.\n\nPassage 3 mentions that shareholders rejected Dudley's pay rise, with 59% voting against it, which is a significant rejection. This is the first time a top British company faced such a rejection. The article notes that other companies like Smith & Nephew also faced similar rejections. The pay was seen as out of line because other energy CEOs took pay cuts. The median pay for S&P 500 energy CEOs fell by 1.8%, but Dudley's pay was higher. BP's board defended the pay, saying Dudley met targets, and the chairman promised to review future pay terms.\n\nPassage 4 details the shareholder vote against Dudley's pay package, with 59% rejecting it. The chairman acknowledged the shareholder concerns and promised to review the pay policy. The Institute of Directors and others warned that ignoring shareholder concerns could lead to government regulations. Investors like Royal London and Sharesoc criticized the pay as too high.

He claimed to have caught a gang of serial killers called Pishtacos, who were extracting fat from victims as part of an ancient Andean legend. The police initially said up to 60 people were murdered, and their fat was sold to Italian cosmetics makers. However, it turned out there was only one victim, linked to the cocaine trade. The police displayed human fat in a bottle of Inca Kola and showed a video of body parts. But later, the investigation was called a botch, and the police chief admitted embarrassment. The regional police in Huanuco said they were excluded from the inquiry and found only one victim. Experts criticized the police for using the myth to explain the crime and for scaring tourists. Doctors and anthropologists pointed out the impracticality of selling human fat and the misuse of the legend.\n\nPassage 2 seems to be a similar story but with some differences in details. It mentions Felix Murga as the investigator, not Eusebio Felix. The police chief is Miguel Hidalgo, same as in Passage 1. The key points are the same: the investigator claimed a gang of killers selling fat, but the story was debunked. The police showed bottles of fat and a decapitated head. The regional police denied knowledge of the gang, only confirming one victim. Medical experts dismissed the fat sale idea, and some think the police used the myth to cover up their failures.

The study in the journal Nature Communications documenting the find explains that \"Caihong\" means \"rainbow\" in Mandarin. Scientists think the colorful plumage, which appeared to have covered the bony-crested creature's head, neck, and chest areas, may have kept the dinosaur warm, as well as attracted potential mates; National Geographic compares it to peacock feathers. So how were researchers able to tell what color feathers the creature had from preserved bones? They used high-tech microscopes able to home in on 66 sites on the fossil, detecting tiny cell structures called melanosomes, which underlie pigmentation. Which colors they led to can be found by their shapes, and the melanosomes in Caihong were long and flat like pancakes—similar to those found in hummingbirds, which boast iridescent plumage. Although they can't pick out from the Pantone wheel Caihong's exact colors, researchers say the creature likely sported feathers with a \"rainbow glimmer.\" Study co-author Xing Zu tells National Geographic that Caihong was a predator that spent its days gliding from tree to tree.

She had a troubled upbringing with an abusive father, became a barrister, then turned to cooking. She was convicted of attending an illegal hare coursing event and later suggested eating badgers from culls. She had a successful TV career, including her own shows, and was known for her love of rich foods and her personality.\n\nPassage 2 gives more details about her early life, her transition from law to cooking, her work on Two Fat Ladies, and her personality. It mentions her book \"Spilling the Beans\" and her memoir. She had a strong dislike for carrots, which she attributed to her father. She also wrote a book on English food history. She was known for her irreverent style on TV, and her show was controversial for its indulgent recipes. After her partner Jennifer Paterson's death, she continued with other shows and was involved in countryside campaigns.\n\nPassage 3 adds more about her career post-Two Fat Ladies, her role as a guild butcher, her work at the University of Aberdeen, and her views on hunting and badger culling. It also mentions her personal life, including her relationship with Clive, her struggles with alcohol, and her financial issues. She was a Catholic but lived her faith on her own terms.

The New York Times describes Wright as a \"rebel,\" both hosts as \"irreverent and eccentric,\" and the recipes as \"sometimes confounding.\" Wright's eclectic working life also included stints as a cook, an author, and a cookbook shop manager; she also ran a catering business, was a guild butcher, and once worked on a yacht in the Caribbean. In fact, she recently said, \"I've had a fantastic life and I've done everything I could have wanted to do and more.\" It wasn't until her 40s, after she'd recovered from alcoholism, that she got into cooking seriously. As for the perhaps-controversial title of the show that brought her fame? \"If you're fat you're fat,\" she once said. \"I hate this modern-day political correctness, that you don't call things by their proper name.\" Her agent remembers Wright similarly in a statement: \"Loved dearly by her friends and many fans all over the world, Clarissa was utterly non-PC and fought for what she believed in, always, with no thought to her own personal cost.\" There's no word on Wright's cause of death, but the Guardian reports that she had been undergoing treatment at a hospital since the beginning of the year."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2870}

They decided not to go to the summit as dusk approached. They used Gary's phone to find a route down the west face, which is known for loose rocks and steep inclines. Jane went ahead to check the route, and Gary asked if it was safe. He heard an exclamation, then a rock fall, realizing she had fallen. He climbed to a safer ledge and called for help. The rescue team found her body 150 meters down. The coroner concluded it was an accidental death. Detective Constable Tim Bird mentioned that the weather was dry, but her light boots weren't suitable, and they took a route that wasn't ideal, possibly mistaking a footpath.\n\nPassage 2 seems to repeat some information from Passage 1. It mentions Chris Lloyd from the rescue team describing the route as not straightforward. Tryfan accounts for 30% of their incidents. Andy Simpson from Mountain Rescue England and Wales advises using maps and compasses with electronic devices. Detective Bird again talks about the Ordnance Survey app being less detailed than a proper map, and the route they took was not the best. The coroner's conclusion is the same.\n\nPassage 3 is a concise summary of the same event. Jane and Gary decided not to go to the summit, used the phone app, Jane fell 30ft down a cliff, the coroner's conclusion, and the rescue team's role.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about Seattle's soda tax, which was implemented in 2018. The tax is 1.75 cents per ounce on sweetened beverages. The former mayor, Ed Murray, supported it for reducing sugar consumption, funding community college, and subsidizing healthy foods. However, the passage criticizes the tax, pointing out that Cook County, Illinois, repealed its soda tax due to public backlash. It argues that the tax doesn't make people healthier, doesn't raise revenue as intended, and actually drives revenue out of the city. The tax has led to significant price increases, like Gatorade going up by 64%, and people are shopping elsewhere, which hurts Seattle's revenue. Also, the tax doesn't apply to milk-based drinks, and Starbucks rejected it. The passage mentions that the West Coast, including Seattle, is seen as a place for paternalistic laws.\n\nPassage 2 focuses on the impact of the tax on Costco. A case of Gatorade now costs $26.33, a 64% increase. Costco has signs directing customers to suburban stores to avoid the tax. The tax is 1.75 cents per ounce, affecting soda, sports drinks, kombucha, but not milk-based drinks. Some residents are upset, calling it regressive and affecting low-income families. There's a call for consistency in applying the tax to all sugary drinks and fast food.\n\nPassage 3 discusses Cook County's repeal of their soda tax. Daniel Stein's vending company lost $75k, and the tax caused sales to drop, leading people to shop elsewhere. Retailers and big soda companies opposed the tax, leading to its repeal. Costco's sales in Cook County dropped 34%, while sales in nearby areas increased. The tax had administrative issues, like applying to food stamps, which caused confusion. Lawsuits were filed, and the tax's impact on small businesses and health care costs is debated. Some public health groups support the tax, but the Cook County version had flaws.\n\nPassage 4 mentions a bill to bring the soda tax statewide in Washington. The tax would add nearly two cents per ounce. Some are worried about the impact on local businesses, like Spokane's King's Bar & Grill, which relies on soda. The tax would also apply to syrups and", "answers": ["\"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles—$15.99—and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let’s be clear. Soda taxes don’t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue—they drive it outside city limits. They don’t help ease inequality—they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide.

Leslie Allen Merritt Jr., accused of being behind four drive-by shootings that hit 11 vehicles on I-10 in August and September 2015, was granted release after his defense team argued that ballistic evidence and phone records cast doubt on the prosecution’s case. Judge Warren Granville imposed a gag order, preventing lawyers from", "answers": ["A judge on Tuesday allowed a man charged in freeway shootings that rattled Phoenix last year to be released from jail amid questions about evidence authorities say links him to the crimes. The judge overseeing the case of Leslie Merritt Jr. reduced his bond to zero and said he can return to his home under electronic monitoring, the AP reports. He was expected to be released later in the day. The reduction of the bond—once $1 million—was a major victory as defense lawyers contend that ballistic tests cast doubt on the claim by authorities that Merritt was behind four of the freeway shootings. \"With all due respect your honor, there's no evidence against him to show he's responsible for this,\" defense lawyer Jason Lamm said. \"He is no more the I-10 shooter than, respectfully, you are.\" Merritt lifted up his shackled arms in celebration as he walked from the courtroom. After the hearing, family members hugged and shook the hands of defense lawyers. Merritt has pleaded not guilty to drive-by shooting, aggravated assault, and other charges. The shootings caused panic on Phoenix-area freeways, where 11 vehicles were hit in August and September. Detectives took Merritt into custody on Sept. 18; in court the next day, Merritt adamantly denied shooting any cars, telling the judge, \"I'm the wrong guy.\" His lawyers immediately began raising questions about the evidence, citing ballistics information and phone records they say provided an alibi for their client.

The study involved 64,000 children and their mothers. They found that frequent use was associated with a 29% higher risk of ADHD diagnosis and 37% for hyperkinetic syndrome. However, the study doesn't prove causation, just an association. The researchers suggest avoiding chronic use but not necessarily single doses. They also mention that other factors like infections or genetic predispositions might play a role. The FDA has limited doses, and the drug company Tylenol says there's no proven causal link.\n\nPassage 2 is similar but more detailed.

The director's previous work with horror films is noted, which might have influenced the film's approach.\n\nPassage 2 gives a more detailed plot summary. It describes Susie Salmon's story, her father's hobby of building ships in bottles, and the antagonist George Harvey. It also mentions the film's visual motifs like the in-between world and the director's background in horror films. There's a mention of the film's structure, focusing on Susie's perspective and the family's search for her killer. Some plot points like the family dynamics and the killer's character are highlighted, along with the performances of the actors.\n\nPassage 3 is a review that criticizes the film for deviating from the book's tone and complexity. It points out that the film simplifies the story, removes some disturbing elements from the book, and focuses more on the fantasy elements. The reviewer mentions that the film is more of a fairy tale than the original novel, which dealt with more mature themes. The performance of Stanley Tucci is praised, but the overall direction is seen as lacking depth.\n\nPassage 4 is a brief summary with some plot details and a rating.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the key points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about the government shutdown standoff between the House and Senate. The House passed a funding bill that includes delaying the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and repealing the medical device tax. The Senate, led by Democrats, is against these changes and plans to block them. There's a deadline approaching, and if they can't reach a compromise, a shutdown might happen. The House Speaker, John Boehner, is under pressure from Republicans to take a hard line against the ACA, even though it might lead to a shutdown. The Senate isn't scheduled to meet until Monday, and there's uncertainty about how they'll handle the bill.\n\nPassage 2 focuses on Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's strategy. He's pushing for a hardline stance against the House Republicans, refusing to compromise on the ACA. Reid and Democrats are determined to avoid any concessions, even if it means a shutdown. They believe the political backlash will hurt Republicans. However, there are risks, like the potential fallout from a shutdown affecting the economy and the Democratic Senate majority. Reid is accused by some Republicans of wanting a shutdown for political gain. The House is trying to pass a bill with ACA changes, but the Senate is set to reject those provisions. If the House doesn't pass a clean bill, a shutdown is likely.\n\nPassage 3 discusses the economic impact of a potential shutdown, especially in the Washington D.C. area. The region could lose billions daily, with significant effects on jobs, federal services, and local businesses. The shutdown would affect federal workers, contractors, and services like parks, museums, and benefits processing. Local governments are preparing for financial losses and have set aside funds. The shutdown could also impact state and local services, like Meals on Wheels and emergency preparedness. The 1995 shutdown is referenced as a cautionary tale, and there are concerns about the ripple effects on the economy.\n\nNow, I need to synthesize these points into a concise summary.

Harry Reid is expected to table the anti-ObamaCare amendments with a simple Democratic majority and quickly send it back to the House—but if any opportunity arises for Senate Republicans to use delaying tactics, expect Ted Cruz to lead the way, the Wall Street Journal predicts. There's a chance of a straight up-or-down vote in the House, but if it becomes clear that it will be impossible to break the deadlock by midnight—which appears to be the likeliest scenario—the partial shutdown could still be averted if lawmakers pass a short-term funding bill to buy another week or so of debating time. So who will blink first? Neither Reid nor John Boehner appears likely to give way. Reid is determined to play hardball and not give an inch on ObamaCare, Politico reports. Reid and his allies believe that giving any concessions now will only lead to bigger concessions to avoid a debt default next month—and they think the backlash from a government shutdown will hit the GOP hardest. Boehner, meanwhile, will face the wrath of his party's conservatives if he gives way too soon—but polls show the public will blame his House Republicans if there is a shutdown.

In less scientific terms, per the Telegraph: \"We will finally touch the sun.\" The nuts and bolts: The mission: The 10-foot probe will launch in July or August of 2018 and eventually get to within 3.7 million miles of the sun, about seven times closer than any previous spacecraft. Eventually, it will be whizzing around the sun at a speed of 450,000 miles per hour, reports CNN. The mission ends in 2025. Corona: The probe will actually fly into the outermost part of the sun's atmosphere, called the corona, per a mission overview at NASA that touts \"humanity's first visit to a star.\" The heat: The probe will rely on a 4.5-inch-thick carbon-composite solar shield to help it withstand temperatures up to 2,550 degrees Fahrenheit, reports Orlando's WKMG. Instruments will remain at room temperature. The name: The probe's name has been changed to the Parker Solar Probe to honor astrophysicist Eugene Parker, who's credited with discovering solar wind. Parker, who turns 90 in June, is a professor emeritus at the University of Chicago, and the Guardian recounts that the theory he put forward in 1958 about a stream of charged particles flowing from the sun was once thought to be \"crazy.\" A first: This is the first time NASA has named a mission after a living scientist. \"I'm certainly greatly honored,\" said the man himself, per Space.com.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the key points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about the Neiman Marcus data breach. Hackers penetrated their network as early as July, and it wasn't fully contained until Sunday. The company disclosed the breach late last week, mentioning that they first noticed suspicious activity in mid-December. They said some customers' payment cards were used fraudulently, but they didn't have Social Security numbers or birth dates. They defended their delayed disclosure, saying they waited to confirm evidence. They also mentioned that the breach was contained by mid-January, and the attack started in mid-July. They didn't mention how many cards were stolen. The breach was criticized for being delayed, and some states are investigating. Also, there's a possibility the breach is linked to Target's, both possibly by Eastern European groups.\n\nPassage 2 is about the Target breach. A report from iSight details the malware used, which was placed in POS systems. The malware was sophisticated, using memory scraping to get unencrypted card data during authorization. The report doesn't name the culprits but points to regions like Eastern Europe and Brazil with the skills. It mentions that this method is new to cybercrime and could lead to more breaches. The report was sent to the Secret Service and obtained by NBC News.\n\nPassage 3 mentions that the Target breach was part of a larger international campaign against retailers. The report from federal and private investigators was sent to financial services and retailers, giving details about the attack's source. It compromised 40 million credit and debit card accounts, and possibly other personal info for 70 million. The report suggests the attack was part of a broader effort.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary. Start with the main events: both Target and Neiman Marcus had breaches. Target's breach was more significant with 40 million cards and 70 million personal details. Neiman's breach started in July, contained in January, and they didn't disclose until late December. Both are under investigation, possibly linked. The methods used involved malware in POS systems, memory scraping, and the attackers are likely from Eastern Europe or Brazil.

The incident happened because the lion attacked a man, leading rangers to kill it. There's mention of the fence being faulty and the lion's escape due to migration. Also, there's a parallel with a lion in South Africa that escaped, and the debate over whether to tranquilize or kill the animal. The article discusses the balance between human safety and lion conservation, noting the decline in lion populations due to hunting and habitat loss.\n\nPassage 2 focuses on the death of Mohawk, highlighting the public outrage. It details how the lion was tormented by a crowd for hours before attacking a boda boda rider. The rangers arrived without tranquilizers, leading to the killing. There's mention of the lion's significance as a tourist attraction, his name origin, and the blame on infrastructure projects near the park for the lion's escape. Officials like Judi Wakhungu are cited, pointing to construction noise and damaged fencing as issues.\n\nPassage 3 repeats some of the details from the first two passages, emphasizing the immediate threat to humans and the decision to shoot the lion. It mentions the third escape in two months, the growing population around the park, and the similar situation in South Africa with Sylvester. The article also notes the IUCN status of lions as vulnerable and the population decline.\n\nPassage 4 provides more context on the incident, the public reaction with hashtags, and the reasons for the lion escapes, such as habitat loss and development.

The reliquary was part of an early Christian basilica, and the ashes were believed to have healing properties. Pilgrims would visit John's grave in Turkey for healing, and the relic was brought back to the basilica.\n\nPassage 2 is more detailed. It mentions the same discovery but adds context about the 2014 excavations at Burgos (Poros) on Cape Foros. The reliquary was found in a 6th-century basilica. Nikolov explains that a pilgrim from the area might have brought the relic back. The reliquary is tiny, with cross decorations. It's part of a rare group of lead tubes from the 6th century, with only 43 known worldwide. Most are in Italy and other places, but this one is unique because its designs match those from Ephesus.

Reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers say they followed nearly 10,000 men and women with CHD between the ages of 35 and 75 for about five years, monitoring changes in body weight and other health outcomes. The takeaway? \"It's important to lose weight, but this data says you have to keep it off,\" lead researcher Dr. Sripal Bangalore at the New York University School of Medicine tells the New York Times. The highest weight fluctuation was on average 8.6 pounds over five years, while the smallest body weight changes averaged closer to two pounds, reports Medical News Today. Those who were already overweight or obese at the beginning of the study and who experienced the highest level of weight fluctuation experienced 124% more deaths, 136% more strokes, and 117% more heart attacks, meaning these CHD patients were more than twice as likely to suffer these negative outcomes in just a few years than people with CHD whose weight only fluctuated two pounds.

{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of the three news passages provided. Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 is about Twitter's new feature allowing users to add locations to their tweets. It mentions that Twitter stores this location data and lets users toggle the location on/off before each tweet. They can also delete their location history. The key points here are the new location feature and user control over it.\n\nPassage 2 is more detailed. It talks about Twitter's response to the bullying of Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, who was targeted with harmful messages after her father's death. The incident led Twitter to update their policies. The article also discusses broader issues of online harassment, citing examples like Imani Gandy's experience with persistent abuse based on her race, gender, and medical condition. There's mention of Twitter's reporting tools not being sufficient, and suggestions for better solutions like the Block Together software. The article also touches on the company's commitment to free speech versus the need for stronger protections against harassment.\n\nPassage 3 is about Alexa Internet donating crawl data to the Internet Archive since 1996, which is added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. This seems like a separate news item about data archiving, not directly related to the other two passages. However, the user wants a summary of all news, so I need to include it.\n\nNow, I need to structure the summary. Since it's a one-page summary, I should condense each passage into concise points. Start with Passage 1: Twitter's location feature. Then Passage 2: the bullying incident, policy changes, broader harassment issues, and recommendations. Finally, Passage 3: Alexa's data donation to the Internet Archive.\n\nI need to make sure the summary flows logically, connecting the topics where possible. For example, Passage 2's main theme is about online harassment and Twitter's response, which is a significant issue. Passage 1 is a feature update, and Passage 3 is a separate tech news item. I should mention all three but highlight the more substantial issues in Passage 2.\n\nI should avoid too much technical detail from Passage 3, just the key fact about the data donation.

They impersonated Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles. The nurse, Jacintha Saldanha, who answered the call, was found dead, and there's speculation it was suicide. The hosts are apologizing, and their show has been canceled. The radio station is halting all prank calls and undergoing reviews. The station's CEO says they tried to contact the hospital before airing the call but didn't get a response.

The station's CEO again mentions contacting the hospital multiple times. There's also a history of the station having previous issues with the ACMA, like the 2009 incident with the 14-year-old girl and the 2012 incident with insults towards a journalist. The station is suspending advertising and the show. The nurse's family is mentioned, and there's a call for stricter media regulations.\n\nPassage 3 summarizes the situation again, highlighting the suspension of prank calls, the review of policies, and the apology from the network.

It mentions that one in seven patients is under 50, which challenges the traditional belief that it's mainly an older man's disease. The study from the University of Michigan suggests that current screening guidelines starting at 50 might be too late. Symptoms are listed, and they mention that colonoscopies and stool tests are options. The study by Dr. Samantha Hendren found that younger patients have more advanced disease but better survival rates.

The study by Hendren's team using SEER data shows that younger patients have more advanced stages (regional or distant) and better survival rates.

The study by Hendren again is cited, with the same data on advanced stages and treatment. They mention that younger patients are more likely to get surgery and radiation. The survival rates are similar. The study's limitations include lack of family history data and possible selection bias. Experts like Dr. Hecht and Dr. Winawer are quoted, noting that symptoms are often ignored and that changing screening guidelines might not be clear yet.\n\nPassage 4 is from HealthDay News, again highlighting the rise in colon cancer under 50. Dr. Hendren is the lead author, and the study is the same as before. It mentions that younger patients are diagnosed at advanced stages but have better survival due to aggressive treatment. The study data is from 1998-2011, with 15% under 50. Dr. Chan is quoted about the unknown reasons for the increase, possibly environmental factors.

The young are also more likely to use radiation therapy (53% to 48%) and have a slight advantage in surviving for five years (68% to 67%). Younger people are more likely to have advanced colon cancer partly because they get tested after noticing symptoms (like colon blockage, bleeding, and anemia), while people over 50 are advised to begin screenings, says Hendren. \"Unfortunately, these symptoms are often ignored by the patient or doctor or ascribed to something like hemorrhoids,\" a scientist adds, per Reuters.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the key points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about a discovery in the Flinders Ranges, Australia, where a rock shelter was found with evidence of human settlement dating back 49,000 years. The discovery was made by archaeologist Giles Hamm and an Aboriginal elder, Clifford Coulthard. They found the site when Coulthard went to the bathroom and discovered a spring with rock art. The site has artifacts like tools, bone fragments, and evidence of fire use. The age of the site was determined through scientific methods, and it suggests that humans may have arrived in Australia earlier than previously thought, possibly 55,000 to 60,000 years ago. There's also mention of interaction with megafauna like the Diprotodon.\n\nPassage 2 is more technical, detailing the excavation methods used at Warratyi. They used hand excavation with specific grids and sieving techniques. They also mention optical dating of quartz grains and radiocarbon dating of charcoal and eggshells. The Bayesian age modeling was used to integrate all the chronological data. The methods are thorough, ensuring accurate dating and minimizing contamination.\n\nPassage 3 summarizes the significance of the Warratyi site. It states that the site is the oldest known evidence of Aboriginal settlement in arid Australia, dating back 49,000 to 46,000 years. The discovery pushes back the timeline of human presence in the arid interior and shows early use of technologies like ochre, bone tools, and axes. The site also provides evidence of human interaction with megafauna, challenging previous theories about their extinction. The collaboration with the Adnyamathanha people is highlighted, and the site's importance in rewriting the narrative about Indigenous Australians' technological and cultural advancements.\n\nPassage 4 reinforces the main points from the other passages. It mentions the Warratyi site as the key discovery, with artifacts dated to 49,000 years ago, indicating humans reached the arid interior 10,000 years earlier than thought. The tools found suggest local innovation rather than being brought from elsewhere. The site's location and the dating methods are discussed, along with the implications for understanding human migration and interaction with megafauna.

Hamm was surveying a section of Australia's Flinders Ranges when his partner, aboriginal elder Clifford Coulthard, had to go to the bathroom. \"Nature called and Cliff walked up this creek bed into this gorge and found this amazing spring surrounded by rock art,\" Hamm says. At the time, Hamm thought the newly discovered human settlement, a site called Warratyi, was only 5,000 years old. It turns out it's closer to 49,000 years old, and that has huge ramifications for our knowledge of ancient Australian civilization, Sky News reports. Hamm and his team published a study on Warratyi this week in Nature. The discovery of Warratyi in the arid interior of the continent means humans either arrived in Australia up to 10,000 years earlier than previously believed—or they expanded across the continent at a much quicker rate, Science Alert reports. Researchers at the site found 4,300 objects, including tools, and 200 bone fragments from multiple animals, including a 5,500-pound marsupial. The bones help explain how early Australians interacted with megafauna, including hunting them. The tools show Australians were using bone and stone axes earlier than believed and are evidence that early Australians developed some technologies on their own rather than adopting them from other peoples as previously believed.

They have strict guidelines, limiting questions to her Vegas residency, new single, and album. The radio stations are told not to ask personal questions. However, some interviews ended up being problematic, like the one with Roula and Ryan where it was a one-sided conversation. There's also mention of Spears possibly lip-syncing in her Vegas show, which she denies. Additionally, there's a mention of her \"Work Bitch\" video where she appears slimmer in the final edit.

Her father, Jamie Spears, has been managing her life since 2008 and is now asking for more money. He's currently paid $16,000 a month and wants the rent for his office increased from $1,200 to $2,000. He also wants reimbursement for an additional $800 per month for office expenses.

The death tolls are mentioned: 56 Israeli soldiers and 3 civilians killed, while in Gaza, over 1,360 Palestinians and 6,500 wounded. Palestinian President Abbas declared a humanitarian disaster and accused Israel of war crimes. There's a 72-hour ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas starting on Friday, with both sides agreeing to it. However, there are concerns about the ceasefire's effectiveness, as Israel wants to complete its mission. The UN and others are criticizing the attacks on UN schools, and there are mentions of international reactions, like the US and UN officials. Also, there are reports of rocket attacks in Israel and some protests in Paris. \n\nPassage 2 provides more details on the conflict. Netanyahu insists on destroying Hamas tunnels regardless of a ceasefire. The military has called up 86,000 reserves. There's heavy fighting, including attacks on UN schools, which have caused casualties. The UN and US are condemning these attacks. The death tolls are similar, with over 1,300 Palestinians and 50 Israelis. Hamas is demanding the lifting of the Gaza blockade as a condition for a ceasefire.

It mentions Snap's IPO and the need to show Spectacles can generate revenue. They're now selling online for $129.99, previously through vending machines and a pop-up store. They're closing the pop-up and will continue with Snapbots. Shipping takes 2-4 weeks, limit of 6 pairs. They also sell charging cases and cords.

Dan Hooper, an astronomy and astrophysics professor at the University of Chicago, posted a paper in the preprint journal arXiv.org arguing that aliens in far-off galaxies may be sucking energy from stars to offset risks posed by an expanding universe, LiveScience reports. \"The presence of dark energy in our universe is causing space to expand at an accelerating rate,\" writes Hooper. \"As a result, over the next approximately 100 billion years, all stars residing beyond the Local Group [of galaxies including the Milky Way] will fall beyond the cosmic horizon and become not only unobservable, but entirely inaccessible, thus limiting how much energy could one day be extracted from them.\" Therefore, he argues, an advanced civilization may use something like \"Dyson spheres\"—an imagined solar-powered satellite dating back to 1930s science-fiction, notes LiveScience—to harvest a star's energy or use that energy to move it closer to home. Hooper hinges his case on the work of Russian astronomer Nikolai Kardashev, who argued in 1962 that technologically advanced civilizations would expand via three steps: harvesting resources of their planet, then the nearest star, then all stars in the galaxy and nearby galaxies.

She's scheduled for surgery to fix her kidney, and then will see a cardiologist. The family is grateful and thankful for support.\n\nPassage 2 explains what a Pseudomonas infection is. It's a bacteria that's common but can be dangerous, especially for people who are weak. It's hard to treat because it's antibiotic-resistant. It can cause serious infections in hospitals, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Symptoms vary depending on where the infection is, and it can lead to septicemia if it spreads.\n\nPassage 3 is about an Oklahoma infant, Oakleigh Nance, who is fighting a super strain of E. coli.

The violations were related to not following lead paint safety protocols during renovations depicted on Fixer Upper. The settlement includes a $40,000 civil penalty, compliance measures, public education efforts, and a $160,000 lead-abatement project in Waco. The EPA found noncompliance in 33 properties. Magnolia cooperated with the EPA, got certified, and agreed to a compliance management program. They also plan to produce educational content and do a community project.\n\nPassage 2 is shorter. It mentions the same $40,000 fine, the 33 homes, and that the EPA noticed the violations by reviewing the show. It also notes the educational video and the $160,000 project. The tone is a bit more casual, even mentioning the EPA having a department that binge-watches renovation shows.\n\nPassage 3 is similar to Passage 1 but more concise. It confirms the $40,000 fine, the settlement details, the educational video, and the $160,000 abatement project. It also mentions the EPA's review of the show's footage and the 33 properties.

{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, I need to write a one-page summary of all the news passages provided. Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 seems to be about a subscription request for Science, but it's not relevant to the other passages. I can ignore that.\n\nPassage 2 talks about discoveries in the Olorgesailie Basin in Kenya related to Middle Stone Age tools and red pigment. The key points are that these tools are the oldest found, dating back 320,000 years, and they suggest climate-driven changes in Homo sapiens and their relatives. The tools were made from obsidian from far away, indicating trade networks. There's also mention of pigment use, which might have been for social signaling. The researchers link these developments to climate shifts and the emergence of H. sapiens.\n\nPassage 3 is a more detailed account of the same findings. It mentions the transition from large hand axes to smaller, more specialized tools around 320,000 years ago. The tools were made with obsidian from distant sources, showing long-distance trade. The use of pigments and the shift from scavenging to hunting are highlighted. The researchers suggest that climate instability, like droughts and earthquakes, pushed early humans to form social networks and trade.\n\nPassage 4 provides context about the previous belief in a \"human revolution\" around 40,000-50,000 years ago, but now the findings show that advanced behaviors like toolmaking and pigment use started much earlier in Africa. The Olorgesailie Basin evidence challenges the idea that modern behaviors emerged only after migration out of Africa. The studies show that climate changes drove technological and cultural innovations, including the Middle Stone Age tools and long-distance material exchange. The transition from Early to Middle Stone Age is linked to Homo sapiens' evolution, but it's not clear if it's directly tied to the species.\n\nNow, I need to synthesize all these points into a concise summary. The main themes are the discovery of ancient tools and pigments in Kenya, the link to climate changes, the development of trade networks, and the reevaluation of when modern human behaviors began. I should mention the dates, the significance of the tools and materials, the role of climate, and the implications for understanding human evolution.

Recent discoveries pushing back the date of departure are helping to change that narrative, as are three new studies in Science. Together, they describe the earliest stone tools of their kind in East Africa as well as the earliest evidence for long-distance transport of raw materials in the region, per Science News. Researchers previously believed the Early Stone Age marked by large, primitive tools (hand axes and cleavers) made way for the Middle Stone Age and its smaller tools (spearpoints and blades) around 280,000 years ago. But stone tools found in Kenya's Olorgesailie Basin show hominin groups—it's not clear which species is responsible—had developed these more advanced tools approximately 320,000 years ago. \"We see a smaller technology, a more diverse series of stone tools … designed for specific purposes,\" researcher Rick Potts tells NPR. An expert not involved in the study says the tools are so \"prepared and retouched\" they suggest the Middle Stone Age likely started even earlier. What drove it? Microscopic and chemical analyses of the region's soil show the landscape was rapidly shifting between wet and dry conditions, meaning hominins might have been forced to adapt. But as the technology also coincides with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, it's possible that the human mind deserves credit. The tools themselves suggest the development of trading networks, too. Some were made of rocks carried from 55 miles away, says Potts.

Chris Taylor is one detractor of the headphone ditch, writing for Mashable that, in nearly 20 years of attending Apple product launches, he's \"never heard anything as ridiculous emanate from that stage as I did Wednesday.\" Apple marketing head Phil Schiller used the word \"courage\" to describe Apple's innovation, but that's not how Taylor sees it. \"Courage is marching across the Edmund Pettus bridge in Selma in 1965 [or] facing down a tank in Tiananmen Square,\" he writes. \"Courage, by definition, involves doing something that makes you afraid.\" Apparently Taylor doesn't think Apple was quivering in its workboots when it came up with this plan. He's got plenty of other words instead of \"courage\" in mind, including \"hubris,\" \"arrogance,\" \"greed,\" and his personal favorite, \"stupidity,\" which he attributes to Apple for taking \"one step forward, two steps back\" both technologically (\"wired almost always sounds better than wireless\") and logistically (no more plugging in other peripherals like credit card readers, for example). Meanwhile, although much of the other feedback online is similarly cranky about the headphone jack's demise, Quartz notes that Apple is actually late, not early, in making this move: A handful of Chinese smartphone brands have been fiddling around with the idea for years, and some have already sent these phones, sans jacks, to market."], "all_classes": null, "length": 2155}

They're reducing the number of boarding lanes from five to two. This is meant to reduce congestion and speed up the boarding process. They mention that the new system has been tested in Chicago and Houston and is now official. Priority passengers (Groups 1 and 2) use Lane 1, while others use Lane 2. They also introduced push notifications for app users. The previous system had five lanes but caused congestion. Competitors like American and Delta have similar systems, but United's new process allows top-tier elites to pre-board before the official start. \n\nPassage 2 is about a joint business agreement (JBA) between United, Copa, and Avianca. They plan to integrate their routes for better service, more routes, and competitive fares. The JBA is pending government approval and aims to enhance competition and customer benefits. They mention economic benefits and expanded codeshare options. The agreement is expected to help underserved markets and improve the travel experience. \n\nPassage 3 mentions that United is addressing overcrowding at gates due to full flights. They reduced boarding lines to two and sent notifications to passengers via mobile devices. They also note that customers had complained about congestion, leading to the new process. The airline is trying to ensure flights depart on time with more passengers. \n\nPassage 4 details the new boarding process again, confirming the two-lane system with color-coded lanes (blue and green). It explains the groups (1-5) and their boarding order. They mention that this change is part of testing since last fall and is now rolling out nationwide. They compare it to American and Delta's changes and note Southwest's different approach.

Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

He also caused trouble in school and was known as a “holy terror,” says Linda Hooper, a teacher who first encountered Cruz in the early ‘80s, when he was 12 years old. But then an amazing thing happened: He started spending more time with Hooper, who would give him tasks to do around the classroom. He eventually began coming for visits at her home, where she lived with her husband and four daughters, often running the nearly eight miles between their two houses to get away from his stepfather. After an incident with his stepfather in 1983, Cruz’s mother asked if he could stay with the Hoopers for a few days till everything blew over. \"He never left\" after that, Hooper says. \"I had him from then on.\" He became a part of the Hooper family, taking on a paper route to make money and doing better in school, placing out of special education classes by the time he graduated. More than a decade later, he was still part of the Hooper family—but he wanted to make it official by asking the Hoopers to adopt him right before his 30th birthday. “He said he wanted to honor us, and it was a big honor,\" Hooper tells Today. \"I’ve always known he loved me, but this really showed he loved us.” The adoption went through in 1998, but Cruz \"was my son from the day I kept him,” Hooper says.

Let me start by reading through each passage carefully to understand the main points.\n\nPassage 1 is about Donald Trump criticizing the media, calling them \"disgusting\" and blaming them for his drop in polls. He's accusing The New York Times of fabricating stories and not covering his rallies properly. He mentions that if the media covered him honestly, he'd beat Hillary Clinton by 20%. There's also mention of him threatening to take away reporters' credentials and his rally where he called the newspaper \"going to hell.\"\n\nPassage 2 covers Trump's campaign plans, like ending nation-building and focusing on counterterrorism, including a new immigration policy with a religious freedom test. Also, Vice President Biden is criticizing Trump as the most uninformed nominee, and Hillary Clinton is trying to mobilize undocumented immigrants (DREAMERS) against Trump's deportation promises. There's also mention of Trump's campaign chairman blaming the media for focusing on his controversial comments instead of his economic plan.\n\nPassage 3 seems to be a continuation of Trump's media criticism, with a note that the author acknowledges the media's bias towards Republicans but points out that Trump's situation is different. However, the passage cuts off mid-sentence, so I need to check if there's more. Wait, the user provided Passage 3 as a separate entry, but it's incomplete. The last line is \"The difference is that Mr. Trump has...\" which is cut off. Maybe it's a typo or incomplete. I'll note that in the summary but focus on the parts that are there.\n\nPassage 4 talks about a New York Times investigation into Paul Manafort's ties to a Ukrainian political party linked to Russian influence. Manafort's connections to a network that looted assets and influenced elections are highlighted. Corey Lewandowski, a former Trump campaign manager, tweeted about the article, which caused some backlash and retweets. There's also mention of Lewandowski's current job at CNN and some sarcastic tweets about the media.\n\nNow, I need to synthesize all these points into a coherent one-page summary.

It isn't clear whether Manafort actually received the cash, which investigators say is linked to a network that also bribed election officials. Manafort's lawyer says his client never received the payments and any suspicions are \"probably heavily politically tinged.\" In other coverage: The Hill reports that there doesn't appear to be any love lost between Manafort and former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski: Lewandowski, who was fired after clashing with Manafort, tweeted a link to the NYT Ukraine story minutes after it first appeared.

Politico reports that Trump targeted the media in a series of tweets Sunday, claiming that he would be beating Hillary Clinton by 20% if the \"disgusting\" media covered him honestly. \"I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process,\" he tweeted. \"It is not 'freedom of the press' when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!\" he added.

He had a surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital where his ears were created from his own ribs. The surgery was primarily cosmetic but helped with his confidence. His parents mentioned that he struggled at school because he looked different, but now he's in a school that's more accepting. The surgeon, Neil Bulstrode, used his mother's ear shape as a template. There's also mention of future research using stem cells to grow ears, which would be less invasive.\n\nPassage 2 seems to be a follow-up or a different angle. It also mentions Kieran's surgery, the same details about microtia, the rib cartilage used, and the psychological benefits. It adds that the hospital does about 40 such surgeries a year, mostly for one ear. There's a part about tissue engineering and stem cells from fat tissue, with research in the US. Kieran had a follow-up operation in six months and was happy with the result, even though it's painful to laugh.\n\nNow, I need to combine these into a concise summary.

I'd also like to be able to wear sunglasses and earphones.\" So surgeons traced an outline of Kieran's mom's ears, removed cartilage from the boy's ribs, and sliced, contoured, and sewed the cartilage. Then they put it in two skin pockets and vacuumed them into the shape of ears. They don't perform any function, but Kieran's plastic surgeon says they can deliver a huge confidence boost: \"If you can change the confidence of a patient at this young age, you can change their whole trajectory in life,\" he said. The ears should last, too, because they're made of cartilage rather than prosthetics, the Guardian reports. Every year about 100 British newborns lack one or both ears (it's called microtia), and the hospital Kieran went to performs the operation about 40 times a year. Scientists hope to one day make ears from the fat tissue of patients, instead of ribs. Kieran might have liked that, since he got so excited on seeing his new ears that he cried \"Wow!\" and giggled—which made his ribs hurt from the operation.

NY Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe ordered a university rep to address a suit filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project by appearing in court May 6 to argue why the college is holding Hercules and Leo. The group, which says the animals are being detained for biomedical experiments, says its ultimate goal is to have the animals released to the Save the Chimps sanctuary in Fort Pierce, Fla., per the NhRP's website. \"This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,\" Natalie Prosin, the project's executive director, tells Science.

Gibson CEO Henry Juszkiewicz described the seizure as a disruption to operations, with federal marshals confiscating wood and halting production. The company denies wrongdoing, claiming all purchases from Madagascar complied with U.S. and Malagasy law and that it ceased importing such wood in 2009.  \n\nThe Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and its director, Andrea Johnson, alleged that Gibson knowingly sourced wood from Madagascar despite a ban on exports of ebony", "answers": ["Allegations of illegal wood imports prompted the Justice Department to raid Gibson Guitar facilities in Tennessee last week.

Gibson insists the wood confiscated by marshals was legally acquired rosewood from India. Adding some gusto to the story, right-leaning sites assert that Gibson rival CF Martin uses the same wood in some of its guitars, but the company was never investigated. The Landmark Report thinks that's fishy, given that Martin's CEO is a Democratic donor and Gibson's CEO is a GOP backer.

The ocean was a mile deep in some places and held 20 million cubic km of water, more than the Arctic Ocean. This evidence comes from infrared telescopes analyzing water isotopes. The study shows Mars was warm and wet in its youth, with long-standing lakes and rivers. The high D/H ratio indicates water loss, leading to the ocean's disappearance. The current water is 13% of the original, locked in polar caps. Scientists like Mumma and Villanueva discuss the implications for habitability and the possibility of life. The Curiosity rover found methane, which could be from geological processes or life, but no evidence yet. The Exomars rover in 2018 will search for life signs.\n\nPassage 3 reinforces the idea that Mars had an ancient ocean covering a fifth of its surface, a mile deep. The evidence comes from analyzing water vapor's isotopic composition. Earth and Mars started with similar H/D ratios, but Mars lost ordinary hydrogen, leading to higher deuterium. The calculation suggests enough water for a 137m global ocean, but likely an ocean in the northern hemisphere. James Kasting notes that the current estimates might be the minimum, and the actual water could be more. The early atmosphere's heavy hydrogen content might have skewed calculations. The conclusion is Mars was wetter and warmer, supporting the possibility of past life.\n\nNow, I need to combine these points into a concise summary.

If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Let me start by reading through both passages carefully to understand the key points.\n\nPassage 1 is about Charlotta Turner, a professor, and her student Firas Jumaah. In 2014, Jumaah sent her a text message saying he wouldn't finish his thesis if he didn't return to Sweden within a week. He was in Iraq with his family, hiding in a bleach factory because ISIS had taken over their village, killing men and enslaving women. Jumaah had gone to Iraq to protect his family after his wife called him. Turner was determined to help and contacted the university's security chief, Per Gustafson. They arranged a rescue with armed mercenaries, and Jumaah and his family were saved. They later completed his PhD and he works in a pharmaceutical company now. The university helped pay for the rescue, and Gustafson said no other university had done something like this.\n\nPassage 2 is a similar story but with some details. It mentions that Jumaah returned to Iraq for a family wedding, stayed behind to finish his work, but then his family was in danger. ISIS attacked Sinjar, killing Yazidis. Jumaah tried to get back but couldn't because borders were closed. He and his family hid in a bleach factory. Turner called him, heard he was desperate, and started looking for a rescue. She approached the security chief, who found a company to rescue them. The rescue was done by armed mercenaries, and they were taken to Erbil Airport. Jumaah felt guilty leaving his family behind but survived. The family paid back the university, and Turner said it was a unique event.\n\nNow, I need to combine these two passages into a concise summary. The main points are: Jumaah, a Yazidi from Iraq, was in danger with his family due to ISIS. He sent a message to his supervisor, Turner, who then organized a rescue with the university's help. The rescue involved armed mercenaries, and they were saved. Jumaah completed his PhD and is now working in Sweden. The university's security chief was involved, and this was a unique event.\n\nI should make sure to mention the key details from both passages, like the specific locations (Sinjar, Erbil Airport), the reason for the rescue (ISIS attack on Yazidis), the method of rescue (armed mercenaries), and the outcome (Jumaah's survival and academic", "answers": ["Four years ago, a chemistry professor got a text from her grad student: If I'm not back in a week, cut me from the doctoral program.

The terror group had just enslaved and massacred Yazidis by the thousand in nearby Sinjar. Now Jumaah and family were planning to flee to the mountains. \"I had no hope at all,\" says Jumaah, per the Local. \"I was desperate.\" But Turner took action. She spoke to Lund University's then-security chief, who contacted a company that sent mercenaries into northern Iraq. Only days later, four armed mercs on two Landcruisers blazed into the place where Jumaah was hiding, and rushed him to Erbil Airport with his wife and two young kids. \"I have never felt so privileged, so VIP,\" he says. \"But at the same time I felt like a coward as I left my mother and sisters behind me.\" Seeing his colleagues back in Sweden, he was speechless: \"I just cried,\" he says. Yet Jumaah finished his PhD and found work at a Malmo pharmaceuticals company, and his family survived.

He used various animals: tortoises for raptors, horses for Gallimimus, a baby elephant for T. rex, donkeys for Brachiosaurus, cows for Triceratops, and even his friend's growl for a raptor attack. The article also mentions that the T. rex roar was made by slowing down a baby elephant's cry.

I can probably ignore this one since it's just about a website archive.\n\nPassage 4 discusses the study on closed-mouth vocalizations in birds. It states that most birds use open mouths, but some use closed mouths for territorial or courtship displays. These sounds are lower frequency and require a larger body size. The study suggests that non-avian dinosaurs might have had this ability too, as they were large-bodied. The research indicates that closed-mouth vocalizations evolved independently multiple times in birds and other archosaurs.\n\nPassage 5 is a follow-up to Passage 1 and 4. It reiterates that dinosaurs might have made closed-mouth sounds, similar to birds. The study by researchers from various universities found that 52 out of 208 bird species use closed-mouth vocalizations, which are linked to larger body sizes. The research connects this to dinosaurs, suggesting they might have had similar vocal abilities. The study also mentions that future research will combine fossils, physiology, and sound modeling to better understand", "answers": ["Dinosaurs may have been much more like modern birds than we knew—and not just because some had feathers. A new study suggests that mighty dinosaurs of yore didn't roar, contrary to every dinosaur movie you've ever seen. Instead, they made a decidedly less scary sound called a \"closed-mouth vocalization.\" Think of a dove cooing or perhaps an ostrich doing this grunting thing. As the scientists explain in the journal Evolution, per UT News, the sound actually comes out of the neck area after air is pushed through an esophageal pouch. In fact, the animal's mouth is shut the whole time. Lots of birds do this today, and because birds descended from dinosaurs, scientists suspect they may have communicated in a similar way. The fossil record can't prove it, though the Washington Post notes that previous research meshes with the idea, including the belief that dinosaurs had air sacs instead of vocal chords. “A cool thing about this work is the demonstration that closed-mouth behavior evolved many times,” says the lead author. “That suggests it can emerge fairly easily and be incorporated into mating displays\" among different types of animals. A co-author says the study gives the impression of \"a very different Jurassic world. Not only were dinosaurs feathered, but they may have had bulging necks and made booming, closed-mouth sounds.\" But if so, the makers of Jurassic Park didn't get it all wrong: The hiss of the film's velociraptors came from a goose, per Vulture.

Zeppos called the inscription on Confederate Memorial Hall \"a reminder of racism, slavery and a very, very bloody Civil War.\" The Nashville university's efforts to change the name in 2002 were halted when the United Daughters of the Confederacy sued. The group’s $50,000 donation in 1933 helped build the dorm. A state appeals court ruled the building could be renamed Memorial Hall only after Vanderbilt gave the United Daughters back their money—$1.2 million in today’s dollars. The university has the cash, thanks to a raft of anonymous contributors who wanted the tie to America’s painful past broken for good. \"It's a symbol that is, for many people, deeply offensive and painful,\" Zeppos told the Tennessean. \"And to walk past it or to have to live in that space is really something that I just don't think is acceptable.” Yet tampering with Confederate imagery remains controversial, and a new state law makes it harder to do so, the AP reports.

Let me start by reading through both passages carefully to understand the key points.\n\nPassage 1 talks about Sony's event where they introduced the PS4. The main points are that the PS4 is a next-gen platform focusing on flexibility, allowing gamers to play anywhere. Mark Cerny, the lead architect, mentions that the development started five years ago, building on the PS3's foundation but addressing its limitations. They emphasize ease of development with an x86 CPU, which is a shift from the PS3's system-on-a-chip. The DualShock 4 controller has a touchpad and 3D camera, similar to Kinect. Features like save states, background downloading, and social functions are highlighted. The PS4 is described as an advanced PC for developers, making game creation easier.\n\nPassage 2 provides more technical details. The PS4 is a PC-like machine with an x86 processor, 8-core CPU/GPU, 8GB GDDR5 memory, and an HDD. Graphics demos show improved visuals compared to PS3 but not a revolutionary leap. There's no backward compatibility with PS3, but PlayStation Cloud allows streaming old games. The DualShock 4 has a touchpad, share button, headphone jack, and light bar for movement tracking. Background downloading and instant boot from sleep are features. Social features include live streaming, sharing gameplay, and integration with Facebook. Personalization based on user habits and remote play via Vita are mentioned. The overall impression is that the PS4 is an evolution of the PS3, not a complete overhaul.\n\nNow, I need to combine these points into a concise summary.

They developed an algorithm that matched neural patterns to the videos, creating a continuous, abstract reconstruction. The key point is that this is the first time dynamic visual experiences are being reconstructed, not just static images. They mention it's a step towards reading minds, including dreams and thoughts. The lead author, Shinji Nishimoto, compares the experience to watching a movie.\n\nPassage 2 is similar but adds more details. It also mentions UC Berkeley researchers reconstructing videos from brain activity, possibly leading to understanding dreams, memories, and fantasies. Jack Gallant, a professor, is quoted about the significance of this leap. The process involves using fMRI data to create a model that maps brain activity to video features. The reconstructed videos are blurry because they layer matching clips. They mention the brain's complexity with multiple modules and the need for more models for better resolution.

The article mentions that this is a symbolic move by House Republicans, led by Kevin McCarthy, to honor Armstrong, the first man on the moon. However, the context is that the House Republicans are not focusing on major legislative issues but are instead engaging in procedural activities. The passage also discusses the sequestration, which is the automatic spending cuts. Republicans are choosing to accept the sequester rather than negotiate a different deal, which would involve tax increases. President Obama is pushing for alternative spending cuts and tax increases, but Republicans are resistant. The House has been in session for only a few days, with many pro forma sessions. The renaming bill was passed with a voice vote, but some Democrats criticized the irony of renaming while cutting NASA's budget.\n\nPassage 2 is more of a commentary piece. The author states that politicians no longer scare them, having survived past crises. The focus is on the sequester, which is supposed to be a severe cut to federal spending. However, the author points out that the sequester doesn't affect congressional salaries, while staffers face pay cuts.

The GOP report found that the focus of the emergency call was more on the cause of the attack rather than rescue plans. There was a mention of a State Department official suggesting Marines wear civilian clothes, but the military didn't deploy. The State Department denied that clothing affected the response time.\n\nPassage 2 is about the final report from the Benghazi Select Committee. The majority report and the additional views by Reps. Jordan and Pompeo show discrepancies between public and private statements. The public statements often blamed the attack on an anti-Islam video, while private communications indicated it was a terrorist attack. The report claims the administration provided a false narrative, with Clinton and others downplaying the video's role. There are examples of emails and calls where officials privately acknowledged it was a planned attack, not a protest.\n\nPassage 3 seems to be about the Internet Archive's efforts to preserve web pages and fix broken links.

Given a lack of new evidence against Clinton, the Weekly Standard uses the report as a tool for blaming Obama. “The Obama administration knowingly provided the American people a false story about the Benghazi attack, its causes, and its consequences,\" the Standard states. How various government agencies responded to the Benghazi crisis is one of the more interesting aspects of the report. According to Politico, a conference call in the midst of the attack included a conversation about whether Marines should wear their uniforms if deployed. Marines changed in and out of their uniforms multiple times while waiting for an answer and were never deployed.

Got all that? When the moon is at or near the closest point to Earth in its orbit (aka, a supermoon), it appears 14% bigger and 30% brighter than full moons that occur at the farthest point in the moon's orbit, though the moon will lose brightness as it enters Earth's shadow, according to NASA. Because of the way Earth's atmosphere bends light, the eclipsed moon will take on a reddish hue, something often referred to as a blood moon, making this rare celestial event \"a super blue blood moon eclipse,\" according to the Miami Herald. The next blue moon eclipse won't occur until 2028. The eclipse will last for 3.5 hours, with the total eclipse stretching for 77 minutes, reports Sky & Telescope.
