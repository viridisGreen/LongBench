Wait, the exact sentence says: \"We created POS annotated dataset of 6946 sentences and 16225 unique words extracted from POS-tagged Nepali National Corpus...\" So the POS annotated dataset has 6946 sentences", "answers": ["3606", "6946"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2835}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking which models or frameworks they compare to in the article. I need to look through the provided text to find the answer.\n\nLooking at the Experiments section, the article mentions comparing their proposed s2sL approach with MLP. Then, in the case of the Anger/Happy classification, they also compare with Eusboost and MWMOTE. So the models they compare to are MLP, Eusboost, and MWMOTE. \n\nThe answer should list these models. The user wants it concise, so I can mention all three. Let me check again to make sure", "answers": ["MLP", "Eusboost, MWMOTE"], "all_classes": null, "length": 2474}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking if their NER model learns from both text and images. I need to check the article to find out.\n\nLooking through the article, the introduction mentions that they build upon state-of-the-art NER with two novel approaches. The first approach is leveraging auxiliary modalities, like images and text. They mention that social media posts often have images and text, and using images can help disambiguate entities. \n\nIn the Proposed Methods section, they describe the MNER model which takes both image and text as input. The modality attention module is designed to handle different modalities", "answers": ["Yes", "Yes"], "all_classes": null, "length": 3784}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking whether they evaluate only on English datasets. I need to check the article to find out.\n\nLooking through the article, under the Experiments section, the Data subsection mentions that they run experiments on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank. The WSJ is a part of the Penn Treebank, which is a corpus of English text. They also mention using skip-gram embeddings trained on the one billion word language modeling benchmark dataset and the WSJ corpus. \n\nIn the Unsupervised POS tagging section, they mention using the entire WSJ corpus for", "answers": ["Yes", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4320}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for the highest MRR score mentioned in the article. I need to find that.\n\nFirst, I'll scan through the article quickly. The introduction mentions that their system achieved the highest 'MRR' score for Factoid Question Answering task in the third test batch. Then later, in the Summary of results section, it says they placed 3rd for Factoid-type questions. Wait, but the exact MRR score is mentioned in the introduction: \"achieved highest ‘MRR’ score for Factoid Question Answering task. Also, for List-type question answering task", "answers": ["0.5115", "0.6103"], "all_classes": null, "length": 6810}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking what datasets the authors evaluated their approach on. I need to look through the article to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I'll check the \"Experiments\" section. In the \"Data\" subsection, they mention the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank for both POS tagging and dependency parsing. They also talk about using skip-gram embeddings trained on the WSJ corpus and a one billion word language modeling benchmark dataset. \n\nIn the \"Unsupervised POS tagging\" part, they specify using the entire WSJ corpus (49208 sentences", "answers": [" Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the Penn Treebank", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4327}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The question is asking how the authors evidence the claim that many engineers find it a big overhead to choose from multiple frameworks, models, and optimization techniques.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the article. The article talks about NeuronBlocks, a DNN toolkit for NLP. In the Related Work section, they mention existing frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. They say these frameworks offer flexibility but require a large overhead of mastering framework details. Then they mention that higher-level abstractions are favored by engineers to hide framework details.\n\nSo the authors are saying that because these frameworks require mastering", "answers": ["By conducting a survey among engineers", "Unanswerable"], "all_classes": null, "length": 1692}
{"pred": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking on which benchmarks the authors achieved the state of the art. I need to look through the article to find where they mention achieving SOTA.\n\nLooking at the \"KBQA End-Task Results\" section, Table 3 compares their system with baselines. They mention STAGG as the state-of-the-art on WebQSP and AMPCNN on SimpleQuestions. Then, the last row of Table 3 says using top-3 relation detectors gives a new state-of-the-art on SimpleQuestions and comparable results on WebQSP. \n\nSo the answer should be the benchmarks", "answers": ["SimpleQuestions, WebQSP", "WebQSP, SimpleQuestions"], "all_classes": null, "length": 4524}
